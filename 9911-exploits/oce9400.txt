 I am aware of the Intelligent Peripherals bulletin by CIAC.

        I have a few plotters / printers under my audit umbrella and
noticed something interesting on an Oce' 9400 plotter.  The printer has
the ability to be a telnet proxy.  Where as a user can hop via telnet to
other hosts.  If the printer is not setup properly the connections will
go unlogged.

         All that is needed is a valid DNS server setup in the plotter
configuration.

192.168.38.244:root> set sysinfo dns 192.168.38.100

And anyone can use the plotter as an anonymous telnet proxy.

Fix:

Enable passwords for the accounts on the plotter:

syntax: set user add <NAME>
         set user del <NAME>
         set user passwd <NAME> [<PASSWORD>]
         set user type <NAME> root|guest
         set user from default|stored

Enable logging:

syntax: set logpath <LOGPATH> name <NEW_NAME>
         set logpath <LOGPATH> type [[-]job] [[-]user] [[-]pgcnt]
[[-]cksum]
                     [[-]printer] [[-]ioport]
         set logpath <LOGPATH> port <TCP-PORT>|email|syslog
         set logpath from default|stored
