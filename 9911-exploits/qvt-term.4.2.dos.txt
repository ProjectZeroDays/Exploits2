Remote DoS Attack in QVT/Term 'Plus' 4.2d FTP Server Vulnerability

PROBLEM

UssrLabs found a Local/Remote DoS Attack in QVT/Term 'Plus' 4.2d FTP Server,
the buffer overflow is caused by a long user name / password,  2000
characters,
and the re-connection to the Ftp Server.


There is not much to expand on.... just a simple hole
