w00w00 Security Development (WSD)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relocation of w00w00.org:
After being relocated, http://www.w00w00.org is up and running.  Although
we are using an old backup of the site (off the mirror), we have added
a new w00bio and w00giving (advisories) section.  When we receive the
newest backup of the site, we'll finish updating (notice all the new
w00quotes!).  You find our bio, articles, code/projects, and advisories
on the site.  Send us your input.

Note on w00w00:
At 30+ active members (in seven countries, three continents, and twelve
US states), w00w00 has grown into the world's largest non-profit security
team.  Of course, we love our nearest competitors, Cult of the Dead Cow
(CDC), at 22-23 members.  [The largest for-profit security team that I am
aware of is ISS's X-Force.]

Discovered by: ktwo (ktwo@ktwo.ca)

When patches/fixes are applied to binaries on UnixWare 7, the original,
unpatched binary files (with the suid/sgid bits maintained) are stored
in /var/sadm.  By default, the permissions on this directory is 755.
This allows normal users to execute and exploit old binaries leftover
from patching.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch:

Run 'chmod o-rx /var/sadm' to remove read/execution privileges for normal
users.
