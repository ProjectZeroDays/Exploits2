There is a problem (seems to be a bug) with Oracle Web Listener where a
resource can be accessed when is shouldn't be able to be accessed:

Consider the following setup:
Access to  http://host/ows-bin/owa/thenormal.app _is_ allowed.

However access to the owa_util package in the same dir is not allowed so
requesting http://host/ows-bin/owa/owa_util.signature causes the Oracle Web
Listener to throw back an HTTP 401 response ie it requires a user id and
password. However by making a request and substituting the _ with %5f (eg.
http://host/ows-bin/owa/owa%5futil.signature)  we're granted access. Or
using %2e instead of the dot (eg.
http://host/ows-bin/owa/owa_util%2esignature ) does the same: we're given
access, then too.

On sites that protect access to owa_util using this method will be at great
risk from queries using showsource, cellsprint, tableprint and listprint.

Version Oracle_Web_listener2.1/1.20in2 on Solaris was tested. More recent
and earlier versions may also be affected but that's not known yet. Anybody
with access to such versions it - could you check?

TIA
