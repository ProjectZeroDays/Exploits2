Remote DoS Attack in TransSoft's Broker Ftp Server  v3.5 Vulnerability

PROBLEM

UssrLabs found a Remote DoS Attack in TransSoft's Broker Ftp Server v3.5,
the buffer overflow is caused by a long user name 2730 characters.
If TransSoft's Broker Server is running as a service the service will start
eating all memory and all computer resource CPU 100%, at the moment of no
more memory, if this happend all system is down :(

There is not much to expand on.... just a simple hole
