Remote DoS Attack in BFTelnet Server v1.1 for Windows NT

PROBLEM

UssrLabs found a Remote DoS Attack in BFTelnet Server v1.1 for Windows NT,
the buffer overflow is caused by a long user name 3090 characters.
If BFTelnet Server is running as a service the service will exit and no
messages
are displayed on the screen.

There is not much to expand on.... just a simple hole


Example:

palometa@hellme]$ telnet example.com
        Trying example.com...
        Connected to example.com.
        Escape character is '^]'.
	Byte Fusion Telnet, Copyright 1999 Byte Fusion Corporation
	Unregistered Evaluation. See www.bytefusion.com/telnet.html
	(Machine name) Login: [buffer]


Where [buffer] is aprox. 3090 characters. At his point the telnet server
close.
