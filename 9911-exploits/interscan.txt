Subject: Interscan VirusWall NT 3.23/3.3 buffer overflow.


A buffer overflow exists on the VirusWall smtp gateway - by sending a long
HELO command you can overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

Example code has been written which will spawn a command prompt on a port
you specify.

Before you shrug this one off, take a look:

The ironic thing here is, VirusWall was designed to prevent viruses and
'malicious code'.

Obviously not a lot of thought was taken before laying their trust into
3rd party 'security' products.

A quick note to the millions out there who would give their right arm to
compromise microsofts network - sorry, their firewall would prevent the
payload from spawning a remote shell.. unless of course it was modified to
stop an existing service to open a port :)
