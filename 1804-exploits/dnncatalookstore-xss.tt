### Notes:

An attacker can use XSS (in CATALooKStore section from DotNetNuke)
to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end useras browser
has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute
the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the
malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive
information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts
can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.
