It is possible to snoop a user's Linux connection through IRC..

DCC Sending the device files /dev/ttyp1 - ? while someone is logged in on
that ttyp to an outside client will send all information sent from that user
to the target client, making it possible to snoop his connection, password
and login

The drawback is the user will not see his own information typed in and may
disconnect, but for those with auto-login scripts, it is possible to recieve
login/passwords, and even /dev/tty1 - etc. can be snooped for those logging
in as root.. I would like some feedback on anyone who may have any ideas or
comments about this.
