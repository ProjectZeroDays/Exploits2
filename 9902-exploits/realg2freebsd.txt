Subject: RealServer G2 + FreeBSD 3.0

There is a memory leak in RealServer G2 which causes FreeBSD 3.0-stable to
crash/reboot randomly (mostly rebooting).

Real has been notified and are working on it.  Their advice is to use as
few plugin's as possible and use the -m <mem> option.

Just a note to you peoples thinking of upgrading.
