Subject: NOBO denial of service

As reported by i-kran@USA.NET approximately a week ago, nobo (a back
orifice scanning detector) has a buffer overflow problem that will crash
the program remotely.  Sending a UDP packet (larger than 1024 bytes) will
give the error:

A network error has ocurred: Message too long (10040-92)

Sending 15 of these packets (the minimum required) will crash nobo (stack
fault in kernel32.dll), with NOTHING recorded to the log file or to the
screen.

I tested this against nobo 1.2 from both Windows 98 and linux, giving the
same results.  Using 'assault' (included with the mIRC script "7th
sphere", I believe) in Windows, for example, I was able to send 15 UDP
packets at 1025 bytes in size, crashing my nobo.  In linux, I was able to
crash my nobo by echoing a string 1025 characters in length, piping it
through nc (with the -u flag), and repeating 14 more times.

I'm sure some nice scripts could be written to do this to a class C
subnet.  The only drawback to this is that it would be rather
bandwidth-intensive (15 x 1025 bytes x 255).

Simply send Big Udp Packets to eg. Port 31337 and Mr. Nobo will see
a Big error message at each Packet!!!
As Default Nobo only Logs on screen and not into file that means
you can erase your Ping!!
I tested this on NT and W95 and after some time it will kill with
a Overflow.

Hi,
Somebody talk above Nobo crash, and how we can do it, is very simple,
just put de lines:

find /|nc -u 10.1.1.17 31337
this make that the NetCat send data to the nobo (bobo) user (10.1.1.17)
from stdin ("find / ").

this break is easy and work over many OSs
