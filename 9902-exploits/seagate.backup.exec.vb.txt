Subject: Backup Exec/McAfee Virus


We have found that the Seagate Backup Exec virus scanning software (McAfee)
can delete "non-infected" Visual Basic class files. Anyone creating custom
software could find that they have lost all their work.

In the Seagate Backup Exec backup log, the "VBA.CLASS.GEN.EXPORT" virus
signature (by mistake) is found in ALL Visual Basic class files. The virus
data files from McAfee incorrectly identify, attempt to clean, fail to
clean, then delete the files. Anyone who has downloaded the Jan. 31st data
files will have this problem.

Seagate Software claimed their responsibility as such:

"This virus protect is a McAfee product, we just us it in the backup exec
product.  Any more then helping you update the files, and basic trouble
shooting, the rest is up to McAfee's."

Seagate has replaced their downloadable files with a Jan 15th version.

Here is McAfee's response:

There was an error where we were detecting this in some visual basic files.
Try getting the current datfiles to see if this corrects it.
Get the datfiles from: http://beta.nai.com.

As you can see, this one, while protecting you, can cause a lot of damage.

Seagate Software ** Technical Advisory **
TO:     Seagate Backup Exec for Windows NT, v7.2 users
Subject:        Virus Scan Option

Dear Valued Customer,

Seagate Software has uncovered a potential data protection issue with one
specific version of the Network Associates' VirusScan signature file
incorporated within the virus protection feature of Seagate Backup Exec for
Windows NT, v7.2.  Because product quality and customer responsiveness are
consistent Seagate Software hallmarks, we take any and all issues very
seriously and have quickly moved to address them.
Seagate Software has determined that users who specifically updated their
virus protection signature files between January 23, 1999 and February 9,
1999, may experience detection of "phantom" viruses when using the "Clean
Infected Files" option of the integrated virus protection, within Seagate
Backup Exec for Windows NT, v7.2. Thus far, testing by Seagate Software has
shown only Visual Basic "class" files (with .cls extensions) susceptible to
this "phantom" virus issue.
The standard operation for the Network Associates' VirusScan API, integrated
within Seagate Backup Exec for Windows NT v7.2, is to first attempt to clean
an infected file.  Then, files that cannot be cleaned prior to backup are
logged in the Seagate Backup Exec for Windows NT log file and, as a
safeguard, removed from the system to prevent further contamination.
Consequently, when using the specific virus signature files downloaded
between January 23, 1999 and February 9, 1999, certain Visual Basic "class"
files are reported as infected and are being removed from the system.  These
files, detailed in the Seagate Backup Exec for Windows NT log file, should
be restored from a previous backup set.
It is highly recommended that every customer who uses this integrated virus
protection option, update to a new release of this file by pressing the
"update virus protection" button, on the tool bar, from within Seagate
Backup Exec for Windows NT v7.2.
By pressing the "update virus protection" button from within Seagate Backup
Exec for Windows NT, the software will connect, via Internet connection, to
our technical support Web site and download a new version of the virus
protection DAT file. In the event that an Internet connection is not
available where Seagate Backup Exec for Windows NT is installed, you will
need to follow the instructions on the following link to update the files
manually:
http://seer.seagatesoftware.com/tnotes/bewnt/010--100703.htm
<http://seer.seagatesoftware.com/tnotes/bewnt/010--100703.htm>
If you specifically updated your virus protection signature files between
January 23, 1999 and February 9, 1999 and choose not to update the virus
protection files as documented, it is highly recommended that you disable
the "virus scanning," "cleaning" and "backup of infected files" functions.
The procedure for disabling this option is on page 83 of the Seagate Backup
Exec for Windows NT Administrator's guide. In addition to the manual, a
detailed explanation of how to disable this option can be found at the
following link:
http://seer.seagatesoftware.com/tnotes/bewnt/010--101286.htm
<http://seer.seagatesoftware.com/tnotes/bewnt/010--101286.htm>
If you are unsure as to when you downloaded the update, you can check the
dates of the virus protection files installed on your system to determine if
they need to be updated.  If the files listed below are installed on your
system, and fall within the modified date specified below, you should update
virus protection files IMMEDIATLEY.
File Name     Modified Date     Bytes
============================================
Clean.dat     1-15-99           208,112
Mcalyze.dat   1-30-98           857,750
Names.dat     1-15-99           438,224
Scan.dat      1-15-99           409,513


It is important to note that in order for this issue to arise, ALL of the
following conditions must be met:
1.      Seagate Backup Exec for Windows NT, v7.2 ONLY is installed.
2.      You must have updated your virus signature files between January 23,
1999 and February 9, 1999.
3.      The 'scan for viruses' option is enabled on your backup jobs.
4.      You must have selected the 'clean infected files' option.
5.      According to our testing, you have Visual Basic 'class' (.CLS) files
that the virus scanning engine has shown to have the 'phantom' virus.

Restating the conditions in another way, the issue WILL NOT be present if:
1.      You are NOT using Seagate Backup Exec for Windows NT, v7.2.
2.      You did NOT update your signature files between January 23, 1999 and
February 9, 1999.
3.      You have NOT selected to scan for viruses during backup.
4.      You did NOT select the 'clean infected files' option.
5.      Again, according to our testing, you do NOT have Visual Basic
'class' (.CLS) files on your system.

In these cases, you will be unaffected by this issue.
In our effort to contact our customers we are using several communications
vehicles, thus you may receive multiple forms of this notification.  We
regret any inconvenience this issue and subsequent communications may cause,
but, like you, we believe that it is better to err on the side of safety,
than take unnecessary risks when it comes to protecting your valuable data.
                                Sincerely,
                                Seagate Software
