Subject: Buffer overflow in Serve-U

     I have successfully reprocuded this overflow in the newest Version of Serve-U.
It totally crashes the ftp program, and also causes stack fault module in tcp/ip stack rendering
the network connectivity useless.  About 10 seconds later, the machine will become unresponsive
and has to be hard rebooted.  This affects every Win98 machine i have tested on, however, an NT
box with SP4 hung the program until the exploit was killed, but not crashing the serve-u itself.
     The exploit is very simple.
Send a file about 1 meg in size to serve-u's ftp port (21).  This can be done with
     cat filename | nc hostname 21

Subject: Re: FW: Buffer overflow in Serve-U

As far as I know Serv-U v2.4a won't crash on NT4. It will crash on Win95/98
if someone sends large blocks of junk. I've traced those crashes to happen
in KERNEL32.EXE, and the call stack does not show any Serv-U involvement
(except that the DLL was working on Serv-U's behalf so it crashes the
Serv-U task). This seems to be a bug in MS's socket stack and not something
I can fix.

If someone has code that crashes Serv-U 2.4a on NT4 please let me know. I'd
be very interested in tracing the crash in Serv-U in that case, and fix
things if possible.
