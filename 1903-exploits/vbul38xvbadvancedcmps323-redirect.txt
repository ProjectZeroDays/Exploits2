# Impact :
***********
This web application vBulletin 3.8.x vBadvanced CMPS v3.2.3 accepts a user-controlled

input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. 

This simplifies phishing attacks. An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause 

the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value 

to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. 

Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts 

have a more trustworthy appearance.

Open redirect is a failure in that process that makes it possible for attackers to steer users to malicious websites.

This vulnerability is used in phishing attacks to get users to visit malicious sites without realizing it. 

Web users often encounter redirection when they visit the Web site of a company whose name 

has been changed or which has been acquired by another company. Visiting unreal web page

user's computer becomes affected by malware the task of which is to deceive the valid actor and steal his personal data.
