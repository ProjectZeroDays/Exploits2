Patch Available for "Download Behavior" Vulnerability

Summary
=======
On September 28, 1999, Microsoft released the original version of this
bulletin, in order to provide a workaround for a security vulnerability in
Microsoft(r) Internet Explorer 5 that could allow a malicious web site
operator to read files on the computer of a person who visited the site.
Microsoft has completed a patch that completely eliminates the
vulnerability, and has re-released this bulletin in order to advise
customers of its availability.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found
at http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/MS99-040faq.asp.

Issue
=====
IE 5 includes a feature called "download behavior" that allows web page
authors to download files for use in client-side script. By design, a web
site should only be able to download files that reside in its domain; this
prevents client-side code from exposing files on the user's machine or
local intranet to the web site. However, a server-side redirect can be used
to bypass this restriction, thereby enabling a malicious web site operator
to read files on the user's machine or the user's local intranet. This
vulnerability would chiefly affect workstations that are connected to the
Internet.
