It seems cans of Pepsi and Diet Pepsi have
a possible remote root problem on them.

While recently eyeing a can of coke while
sitting on my terminal I noticed that I could
actually drink from it while standing at a
distance of at least 3 feet.

The sploit:

Now when I first did this I was amazed and had
to have a couple friends test it out before I
submitted it so here it is...

<beginpheer>
ssh root@box.of.straws
password ********

login denied

ssh root@box.of.dixie.straws
password ********

Welcome to Dixie Straws

#[skr1ptkid@dixie.straw]su
[s/key 99 xp03r33t]

#[skr1ptkid@dixie.straw]skey 99 xp03r337
Enter secret password:

DONT REWT THIS BOXN PLSE
#[skr1ptkid@dixie.straw]su
[s/key 99 xp03r33t]
Response:DONT REWT THIS BOXN PLSE

#
#
#cat straw straw straw straw >> super.straw
#mv superstraw ~/.superstraw *note... had to rename as .superstraw to hide
from a normal ls*
#
#cd ~
#ftp can.of.coke
#(username) anonymous
#(password) mike@hunt.com *note uberleet alias*
#prompt
#mput ~/.superstraw
#quit

================================================

Now there is no known resolution to this problem as of yet,
but I will be working to ensure that no one else remotely
close to my can of coke can root it.

Temporary fix:
I personally suggest something along these lines of
security.

===================================================
# !/dev/mouth
# sil@antioffline.com
# securepep.sh

PATH=/dev/

echo SecurePep.v1
/bin/tar -cf saliva.tar ~/mouth/*
scp saliva.tar root@can.of.coke:/;
tar -xvf saliva.tar

echo Now no one wants to drink any

===================================================

Now this obviously has been done for fun, so cheers
to those who enjoy a laugh and a big =P to those
who don't... You only live once ;)
