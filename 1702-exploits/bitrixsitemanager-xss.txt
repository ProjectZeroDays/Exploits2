Vulnerable was the last version of Bitrix Site Manager at 12.06.2015, when I 
found this vulnerability on web site of Russian terrorists. At that time I 
wrote at Facebook about hack by Ukrainian Cyber Forces of that site 
http://on.fb.me/1H05ccm and published results of our work with it.

You can read about work of Ukrainian Cyber Forces
