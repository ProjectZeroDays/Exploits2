[Part #1: Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: 794]

It is possible to totaly destroy the server by overflowing the server.
When the attack is made the part of sambar that controls port 80 is
damaged and becomes useless.

The attack is made by your browser, you should connect to the server to
this URL:
www.sambar.com/session/adminlogin?RCpage=/sysadmin/index.stm (when
www.sambar.com is the name of your sambar server).

When it asks for username/password enter very long username and password
(over 256 chars), you will know that it's long enough when you won't see
anymore what you typed, you must enter ir in both username and password.

Repeat this proccess for some time (about 5-10 times), you won't see any
result but the next time the server is started it will show message box
that says: "Failure initilazing server, see server.log".
