On solaris (maybe also AIX) the installation of WebSphere from IBM
installs a deinstallation shell script in /usr/bin with protection 777.
This script is also called by 'pkgrm', which has to be issued by
root. The script can therefore be easily used for placing a troian
horse etc. Besides this dangerous protection settings, WebSpher places
GIF, lst and db files in /usr/bin and all directories of WebSpher are 777.
