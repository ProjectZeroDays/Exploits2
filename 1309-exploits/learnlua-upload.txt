One of the features is the ability to upload files via ftp & http when the 'Computer<->This machine' is selected.


Vulnerabilities: 'iOSftp' & http unauthenticated file uplolads. The application is sandboxed, but any remote user can read/write to the devices storage.

The uploaded content is served out of the http servers directory. While the http server doesn't process server side scripts it is possible to upload and serve malicious / illegal content.Â 
I would think it's also possible to fill up the devices storage as well but did not test it.

Using binary mode to transfer files.

http server listening on port 8080 allows arbitrary file writes to storage.
You can create directories out side the upload path through the file upload web interface and the .. bug.
Because the application is sandbox I was unable to overwtite application executables and components so impact is limited. As stated above you can serve malicious content (javascript/html) via http.
