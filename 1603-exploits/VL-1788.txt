FreelancePHP
Product: WP External Links - WordPress Plugin (Web-Application) 1.8


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple client-side web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the
official WP External Links v1.80 wordpress plugin.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script
codes to the application-side of the vulnerable modules.

The vulnerabilities are located in the
`[ignore]`,`[title]`,`[no_icon_class]` and `[class_name]` values of
the `wp_external_links-main`,
`wp_external_links-seo` or `wp_external_links-style` module POST
method request. Remote attackers are able to inject script codes to
the
application-side of the affected modules. The attack vector of the
issues are persistent and the request method to inject is POST.
The injection point are the input fields and the execution occurs in
the main context sub menu after the inject.

The security risk of the application-side vulnerabilities are
estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system)
count of 3.5.
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerabilities requires a
privileged web application user account and low or medium  user
interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects,
persistent load
of malicious script codes or persistent web module context manipulation.
