Aloha,

f.lux suffers from a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

"flux-setup.exe" loads and executes dll from its "application directory".

For software downloaded with a web browser the applicationdirectory is
typically the user's "Downloads" directory: see <
https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2008/09/carpet-bombing-and-directory-poisoning.html
>,
<http://blog.acrossecurity.com/2012/02/downloads-folder-binary-planting.html
>
and <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/134> for "prior art" about
this well-known and well-documented vulnerability.


If an attacker places malicious DLL in the user's "Downloads" directory
(for example per "drive-by download" or "social engineering") this
vulnerability becomes a remote code execution.


Proof of concept/demonstration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a malicious dll file and save it in your "Downloads" directory.

2. Download "flux-setup.exe" from https://justgetflux.com/ and save it in
your "Downloads" directory.

3. Execute "flux-setup.exe" from your "Downloads" directory.

4. Malicious dll file gets executed.

Fixes will be available in next build.

Chao!!
