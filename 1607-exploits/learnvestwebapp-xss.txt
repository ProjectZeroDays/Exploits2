*# Impact of attack: *An attack can perform Cross Site Scripting attack and
steal the cookie of other active sessions. An attacker would exploit a
vulnerability within a website or web application that the victim would

malicious script to the victimâ€™s browser. An attacker might be able to put
stored XSS into the website.

*# Recommendation:*
Use an appropriate combination of white listing and blacklisting to ensure
only valid and expected input is processed by the system.Furthermore,
classes within the output tag libraries should also be modified to encode
potentially dangerous characters with their HTML escape Counter parts.
