Aloha,

*python-3.5.2.exe* loads and executes fwbase.dll from its "application
directory".

For software downloaded with a web browser the applicationdirectory is
typically the user's "Downloads" directory: see <
https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/cert/2008/09/carpet-bombing-and-directory-poisoning.html
>,
<http://blog.acrossecurity.com/2012/02/downloads-folder-binary-planting.html
>
and <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Aug/134> for "prior art" about
this well-known and well-documented vulnerability.


If an attacker places one of the above named DLL in the user's "Downloads"
directory (for example per "drive-by download" or "social engineering")
this vulnerability becomes a remote code execution.


Proof of concept/demonstration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create malicious dll file and save it as fwbase.dll in your "Downloads"
directory.

2. Download Windows x86 executable installer from
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/
 and save it in your "Downloads" directory.

3. Execute python-3.5.2.exe from your "Downloads" directory.

4. Malicious dll file gets executed.

Chao!!
