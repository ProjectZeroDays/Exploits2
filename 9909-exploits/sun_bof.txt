1.  Bulletin Topics


    Sun announces the release of patches for Solaris(tm) 7 and 2.6 (SunOS(tm)
    5.7 and 5.6) which relate to a buffer overflow vulnerability involving
    the LC_MESSAGES environment variable.


    Sun recommends that you install the patches listed in section 4
    immediately on systems running SunOS 5.7 and 5.6.



2.  Who is Affected
        
    Vulnerable:     SunOS 5.7, 5.7_x86, 5.6, 5.6_x86.


    Not vulnerable: All other supported versions of SunOS.



3.  Understanding the Vulnerability


    In libc, the LC_MESSAGES environment variable affects the behavior of
    messaging functions.  A vulnerability exists where a buffer overflow
    could be exploited to gain root access.  The patches listed in this
    bulletin address both libc and the ufsrestore and rcp binaries which
    are statically linked against libc.



4.  List of Patches


    The following patches are available in relation to the above problem.
