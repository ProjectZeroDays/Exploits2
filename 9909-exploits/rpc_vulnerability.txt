BASS includes RPC support, and was designed with bulk in mind (It was
developed for the Internet Auditing Project). It will only take a few
minutes of trivial effort to update the scanner (I might just do it
myself). Besides being a bit out of date, it's well suited for the
task.


RPC support is based on portmapper however, so you won't fair well
if the network is behind a firewall.


You can grab it at:

BTW, Unless you're running a Linux libc5 (our original development
system), you'll need to apply the bugfix patches posted on Bugtraq a
few weeks ago (Yes, a new version *is* in order).


Fyodor's nmap, especially with RPC support is really an excellent tool.
However, with nmap:
1) It may take a while to comprehensively scan a very large network.
2) It merely detects the presence of a service, and does not test for
   vulnerability (by attempting an overflow and evaluating the
   response, or the lack of one).
