Plugin Description :
 
Social Essentials provides you with:

A simple way to add social sharing buttons to your posts and pages.
A simple way to add a call-to action to your buttons, to increase social engagement.
Stats that show you how much your content is being shared, in detail.
The following social networks are supported for both stats and buttons:

Twitter
Facebook (like/share button)
Google+
StumbleUpon
Pinterest
We've chosen to include these, because they are the most powerful in terms of driving traffic to your site. It's better to focus on the top networks than to add buttons for hundreds of social sites that no one uses.

This plugin now features improved Pinterest buttons! The plugin works around the inherent limitations of the Pinterest sharing button and offers the visitor a choice of which image on your page they want to pin. Alternatively, you can also have full control and manually select the image URL and description text for the Pinterest share.
