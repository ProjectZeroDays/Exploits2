#Description :
PHP Melody was created by Andrew Rae back in the autumn of 2007 as a
simple music videos gallery. During its 8 years of existence, PHP
Melody has evolved from this minimalist video gallery into an extended
Video CMS. At the present time, PHP Melody is developed entirely by
Paul, while Andrew manages the project and provides customer support.
