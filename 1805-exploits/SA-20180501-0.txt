Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Incorrect Privilege Assignment

When a user is logged in https://colt.calamp-ts.com/dashboard/login , a service that is being used by many vendors (such as viper smartstart and directed smartstart) it makes a request to
https://reporting.calamp.com/jasperserver-pro/ to login with the same user.This server is used to generate reports regarding users vehicles using TIBCO jaspersoft server.
When the reports are run from the dashboard they are limited to user owned vehicles but this is not the case when accessing the jaspersoft server directly.
Any report on any user vehicle can run, making location / past whereabouts of vehicles and users available.A lot of financial data reports are also available.
Data sources are also viewable / editable / exportable .After exporting clear text passwords of data sources are available.
As data sources are editable a ddos can be caused just by editing them.
As data sources are correctly firewalled no direct access is possible.
We can manipulate by editing existing reports , adhoc views and queries to access all the data on the underlying data sources and using it to lead to a full compromise of the platform.
Exploiting this also gives access to connect.calamp.com database.
