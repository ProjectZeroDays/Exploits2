# Description :

This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting ( XSS ) attacks.

Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious
code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user. Because a browser cannot know if the script
should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access
any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser.
