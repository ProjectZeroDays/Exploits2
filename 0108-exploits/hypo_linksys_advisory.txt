1. Overview:

The Linksys "EtherFast 4-Port Cable/DSL Router" is subject to a security flaw in its
design.  Passwords for the router and the users ISP account can be viewed in the HTML
source code stored on the router.



2. Details:

The login passwords for both the router and the users ISP are passed to the routers 
configuration  pages.  While they cannot be viewed directly in the browser window the 
passwords are in "cleartext" if viewed via the HTML source code.  This may lead to a 
compromise of the router and the users ISP account.  The pages in question are index.htm, 
which contains the users ISP logon and password, and Passwd.htm, which contains the 
password for the router.

If combined with a "sniffer" attack the source code (with passwords) can be viewed during 
transmission to the administrators browser.

(Note: The transmissions can only be "sniffed" within the LAN behind the router.)



3. "Exploit"

There is no exploit code needed to exploit this vulnerability.  The passwords are stored
and transmitted in "cleartext" within the HTML source.  The passwords can easily be viewed
by sniffing the ethernet when an Administrator logs in and views the offending pages.

Sections of offending code (code formatted for easier viewing):

On index.htm:

--- code cut ---
<b>User Name: &nbsp;</b></font><input name=pppoeUName size=20 

maxlength=63 value=USERS_ISP_LOGIN_HERE>

</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor=6666cc>&nbsp;</th>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; <font face=verdana size=2><b>Password: &nbsp;
&nbsp;</b></font><input type=password name=pppoePWD size=20 maxlength=63 

value=USERS_ISP_PASSWORD_HERE></td>

--- end code cut ---


On Passwd.htm:

--- code cut ---
<br>Router Password: &nbsp;</th><td> <br> &nbsp; 
<input type=password name=sysPasswd size=25 maxlength=63 

value=ROUTER_PASSWORD_HERE>

<font color=blue face=Arial size=2> 
(Enter New Password)</td></tr> <tr><th bgcolor=6666cc align=right><font
color=white face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;</th> <td> &nbsp; 
<input type=password name=sysPasswdConfirm size=25 maxlength=63 

value=CONFIRM_OF_ROUTER_PASSWORD_HERE>

--- end code cut ---



4. Possible Solution

A suggested solution for this problem is to not transmit the passwords to the offending
pages. Instead, keep them stored in the router, and only allow for the update of
passwords on the pages (if desired by the user).

This particular solution is not possible without a vendor patch.  
There has been no resopnse from Linksys.


Another solution has been given by weld on the vuln-watch list.

He states:
"I would say the solution is to only admin the router from a workstation that
is directly connected to one of the switch ports and to add a static arp cache
entry for the router on the workstation.  That will deny any arp cache poisioning
which would work to sniff across the switch."
