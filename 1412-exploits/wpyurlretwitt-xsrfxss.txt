# Title: CSRF/XSS Vulnerability in yURL ReTwitt WP Plugin 
# Author: Manideep K	
# CVE-ID:  CVE-2014-9341
# Plugin Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/yurl-retwitt/
# Version Affected: 1.4 (probably lower versions)
# Severity: High 

#About Plugin:
This plugin will allow your readers to publish a RT (Re-Twitt) on twitter, quoting the user name of your choice, your post's (or page) title and its url (shortened by http://yurl.fr/ )

# Description: 
# Vulnerable Parameter: yurl_login, yurl_anchor etc
# About Vulnerability: This plugin is vulnerable to a combination of CSRF/XSS attack meaning that if an admin user can be tricked to visit a crafted URL created by attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering), the attacker can insert arbitrary script into admin page. Once exploited, admin’s browser can be made to do almost anything the admin user could typically do by hijacking admin's cookies etc. 

# Vulnerability Class:   	
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29	        
Cross Site Scripting (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)) 

#Steps to Reproduce: (POC):
After installing the plugin

You can use the following exploit code to exploit the vulnerability. For testing - you can just save it as .html and then get it clicked with an logged in administrator (by social engineering/spear phishing techniques) and see exploit in action
Almost majority of the fields are vulnerable to CSRF + XSS attack. You can give valid xss payload such as " "><script>alert(32)</script> " in place of "Csrf testing" string
