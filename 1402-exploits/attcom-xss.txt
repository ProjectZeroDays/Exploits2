Corporation) former
American Telecommunication & Telegraph


Vendor Overview

=========================
AT&T Corp., originally the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, is the
subsidiary of AT&T that provides voice, video, data, and Internet
telecommunications and professional services to
businesses, consumers, and government agencies. During its long history,
AT&T was at times the world's largest telephone company, the world's
largest cable television operator, and a regulated
monopoly. At its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, it employed one million
people and its revenue was roughly $300 billion annually in 2006.
In 2005, AT&T was purchased by Baby Bell SBC Communications for more than
$16 billion ($19.1 billion in present-day terms). SBC then rebranded itself
as AT&T Inc.
Today, AT&T Corporation continues to exist as the long distance subsidiary
of AT&T Inc., and its name occasionally shows up in AT&T press releases.
In 1880 the management of American Bell had created what would become AT&T
Long Lines. The project was the first of its kind to create a nationwide
long-distance network with a
commercially viable cost-structure. The project was formally incorporated
in New York State as a separate company named American Telephone and
Telegraph Company on March 3, 1885.
Starting from New York, its long-distance telephone network reached
Chicago, Illinois, in 1892.


Brief Description
============================
This problem allowed reproduction and execution of third-party
heterogeneous code which defied user -> vendor trust levels, and
consequently affected user
and product Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of information
(CIA); as outlined by security practises and in accord to formal
international standards,
namely (ISO/IEC 27001), (BS 77999) and (ISO/IEC 27002).


Visitors, Users and products were directly impacted due to the default
levels of trust for the provision of confidentiality, integrity and
availability of information.

91233))'bad%3d'%3e&tier=TS_PROD>

Description:
The variable 'tagtype' due to character encoding and insufficient data
sanitisation is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting.
The variable is thus changed to
att'sTYLe='att:Expre/**/SSion(prompt(313371))'bad='>

'att:Expre%2f**%2fSSion(confirm("xss"))'bad%3d'%3e&tier=TS_PROD

Description: A confirmation window would prompt the user for confidential
information. Defacement of the website could also occur through an 'Image
onload event'
e.g: IMG onload="JavaScriptCode".
A malicious user could take advantage of this problem thus to impersonate
authenticated users, and to exploit user's or to execute open
url/javascript execution from third-party heterogeneous sources,
or to install untrusted components exploiting inherent O/S and browser
vulnerabilities, and without any prior notification.


Responsible Disclosure Timeline
==========================
[+] 8th of August 2013 -     Informed vendor concerning this security
realisation.

[+] 8th of August 2013 -     Vendor acknowledgement of the problem.

[+] 11th of August 2013 -    Feedback request on remediation procedures

[+] 9th of December 2013 -   Problem remediation process.

[+] 27th of February, 2014 -  Public Disclosure.


Recommendations for QoS and Security Compliance
=========================================
The recommendations made to AT&T Corp were therefore:
To consider encrypting the view state of the application. Furthermore to
implement a stronger Cross-Site Scripting protection.
Apparently XSS filtering is not properly applied, and meta-character
filtering allowed data input over the HTTP protocol to inject third-party
untrusted code, in  JavaScript, Active-X and Visual Basic Script.
Please note that malicious users could take advantage of such instances, as
we have seen in malware and virus propagation instances - with a severe
impact
to systems of strategic and political importance.


Our consultation to AT&T Corp, has therefore been, for a full and urgent
security risk assessment, as outlined in (ISO/IEC 27001), (ISO/IEC 27002),
and (ISO/IEC 27005).
and furthermore the effective enumeration and revisitation of upper-level
security policies.


Dissemination of information is often gathered in the form of a hyperlink,
either through an e-mail message, social networking websites, forums and
other online sources. A malicious adversary could take advantage of this
vulnerability, for: the
mass exploitation of unsuspected users, through malware and virus
propagation instances. A malicious user could also use defects in the
encoding methods, so that the propagation is further obfuscated, and avoid
detection.


Appendices
============================
A. We have consulted AT&T Corp to consider the filtering of meta-characters.
B. To review server-level encoding of < and > to < and > in application
output.
C. Therefore it is known, that a Cross- Site Scripting attack could embrace
mass-user and product exploitation, theft of confidential information such
as: credit cards, passwords, security tokens and secure accounts.
Furthermore the use and exploitation of Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities have been widespread in notable cases of malware
propagation to systems of strategic and political importance such as
Stuxnet and Duqu.
D. I have consulted AT&T to consider filtering < and > and to use
appropriate encoding methods.
where ( and ) are also filtered and encoded to ( and ),
Example cited:
# and & should be converted to &#35 (#) and &#38 (&).
