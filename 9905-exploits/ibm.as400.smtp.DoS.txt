Hello all.

I played around with smtp on a as/400+domino machine and found two
obvious bugs, then notified IBM, revieved a ptf, then posted here.

1:  telnet (host) 25, then start feeding chars. After about 200-300
chars the smtp-subsystem will die, needing to be restarted.

2:  change your replyto-address and fromaddress to an non-existing
user/domain then mail to an non-existing user on the 400/domino. This
will cause the mail to loop endlessly between the smtp-subsystem and the
domino subsystem.

This is for general knowledge only, trying to "force" people with
400/domino to react and secure their machines.

Sincerely,

Yeah, i found this a while back on non domino smtp daemons on as400's also.
it's a somewhat simple solution to fix (just turn the SMTP service back
on), but SMTP can be shut off across the network.  i know this worked on
as400 3.X, i haven't had a chance to test on any of the domino types or the
4.X OS levels

This is good known bug which is not related to AS/400 at all.
This causes to die only Lotus Domino 4.6.1.
I've tried to kill our Lotus Domino 4.6.4 and it still alive ~80)

As for SMTP and Lotus Notes/Domino this is a big problem for it's users
because there no any anti-spam protection like in Sendmail.
Now we are playing with 5th Lotus Domino and there are all this bugs fixed
and anti-spam implemented ~80)

In fact, you can disable mail forwarding, and thereby avoid the Spam threat
by adding this undocumented parameter to the notes.ini file:
SMTPMTA_REJECT_RELAYS=1

Any mail forwarding will bounce directly back to the sender.

There are still problems with Domino anti-spam: If you send a smtp mail
to a domino user who's forwarding address is a smtp address, the domino
smtp MTA will reject the message.

This is security related only by the fact that most of the notes admins
will choose to disable anti-spam after encountering this problem first.
