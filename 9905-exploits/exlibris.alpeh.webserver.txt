Subject: ExLibris Aleph Web server Security Alert

We have found a security hole in web server bundled with Aleph librarian
system ver. 3.25 and higher (ExLibris). The web server in its default
configuration allows anybody to view any file in the system the aleph
instalation owner can access.

It it very simple to grab for example /etc/passwd file from Aleph web
server.

The bug with all details was already posted to ExLibris
and to some groups of Aleph users.

Workaround:

1) do not run web server as root at any circumstance!
2) use /etc/shadow or similar system
3) use tcpd wrappers for denying possible logins
4) watch logs from web server

Please spread this message to Aleph admins!
