Subject: Buffer overflows in FTP Serv-U 2.5

Hi,

It looks like there are some buffer overflows in FTP Serv-U 2.5 (the most
recent version) and I guess they are present in the versions before too,
but I haven't checked that. If you send:

cwd xxxxxxx...
ls xxxxxx...

and so on (it works for all commands I tried which takes arguments), the
server will crash if the number of characters is 155 or more. If the number
is exactly 155 it crashes without any message, and if the number is 156 or
more Dr. Watson starts. I ran the server on Windows NT 4.0. Can anybody
verify this?

Hi Arne,

Thank you for pointing out this bug! I have already traced and fixed it,
and made a beta available at ftp://ftp.cat-soft.com/beta/ which addresses
this.

I would have appreciated it if you would have told me a few days before
posting this to the NTBUGTRAQ list. I am not afraid of bugs, I'm sure there
are more in Serv-U, but now friend and foe know how to remotely crash a
Serv-U FTP server and many Serv-U users are finding out their servers are
being deliberately crashed over and over (not to mention I have to deal
with the resulting flood of E-mail while I could use that time more
productively). It takes several days to fix a bug, and get it tested,
before an update can be released. That leaves many hanging until an update
is out. You know, it's not only the good guys that are subscribed to
NTBUGTRAQ...

Best wishes,

        Rob
