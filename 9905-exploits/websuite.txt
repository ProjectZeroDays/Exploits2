Advisory: Buffer overflow in SmartDesk WebSuite v2.1
Platforms Affected: Windows NT, Windows 98
Found by: cmart (cmart@staticusers.net)
Date: 5/23/99

Description:
----------- 
WebSuite v2.1 will crash when an additional 250+ characters
is appended after the sites URL on NT Server 4 and NT 
Workstation 4 boxes.

Running on top of Windows 98 it will crash with 150+ characters 
appended after the sites URL. 

After reinstallating on both platforms several times, the
overflow string length varied.  Approximately 1 out of 8 times
the overflow string went from 150 chars (Win98) to about
1000+ chars.  It also went from 250+ chars (NT) to about
2000+ chars.

After the server crashes on NT Workstation 4, it's unable
to find the lib file sysclass.flb.  (On our tests).
