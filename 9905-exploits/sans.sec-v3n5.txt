7) NT/WIN95/WIN98 SECURITY PROBLEMS AND PATCHES 

The Microsoft Security page is located at: 
        http://www.microsoft.com/security/ 

Additional NT Security Related web pages may be found at: 
        http://www.ntbugtraq.com/ 
        http://www.ntbugtraq.com/ntfixes.asp
        http://www.ntsecurity.net/ 

                        --------------- 
A) 05/20/1999 - Microsoft released a patch that corrects
a security vulnerability in the Window NT Remote Access Service (RAS)
on client machines.  The vulnerability, which results from a "malformed
phonebook entry", could leave the client vulnerable to a denial of
service attack and under certain conditions, allow a remote user to
execute arbitrary code.  Affected software versions NT 4.0. For more
information refer to the Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS99-016) at:
        http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-016.asp

                        --------------- 
B) 05/17/1999 - Microsoft released a patch that corrects the 
"Malformed Help File" vulnerability. The vulnerability, which results
>from the ability to write an unchecked buffer (hence the malformed
files), may allow a user to run arbitrary code on an Windows NT.  The
patch will prevent the code from being executed but does prevent the
writing of the files. For more information refer to the Microsoft Security
Bulletin (MS99-015) at:
        http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-015.asp

                        --------------- 
C) 05/07/1999 - Microsoft released a patch to correct a vulnerability
in the Excel 97 virus warning mechanism. The virus warning feature in
Excel 97 is intended to warn the user before launching/opening an external
file. However, under certain conditions, this feature can be bypassed.
For more information refer to the Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS99-014)
at:
        http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-014.asp

A Microsoft Knowledge Base article is also available at:
        http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q231/3/04.asp

                        --------------- 
D) 05/07/199 & 05/14/1999 - Microsoft released a bulletin and later an
update, regarding a "file viewers" vulnerability. The vulnerability,
which is present in some viewers that are shipped as part of IIS or the
Site Server, may allow a web site visitor to view files on the server
if they are able to guess the name of the file and have access rights
to the file as granted by NT ACLs. The vulnerability does not allow the
web site visitor to modify or upload files.

Affected versions are Site Server 3.0 (this version is included with
the Commerce Edition), MS Commercial Internet System 2.0, MS BackOffice
Server 4.0 and 5.0 and MS IIS 4.0.  Patches are not available at this
time; however, there are steps customers can take to eliminate the
vulnerability from their site.  For more information, see the Microsoft
Security Bulletin (MS99-013) at:
        http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-013.asp

A Microsoft Knowledge Base article is available at:
        http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q231/3/68.asp
        
                        --------------- 
E) 04/21/1999 - Microsoft released patches for IE versions 4.0 and 5.0
that correct three separate vulnerabilities.  The first vulnerability
is similar to the cross-frame security vulnerability where a malformed
URL can be used to execute a script on a server web site. The second
vulnerability, which only affects IE 5.0, is a new variant of the
"untrusted script paste" problem. The third problem involves the "IMG
SRC" tag in HTML which identifies and loads HTML file.  However, the
tag can be used to point to any file type, thus potentially exposing
sensitive information.

Affected versions are IE 4.0 and 5.0 on win95, win98 and NT 4.0 platforms.
For more information see the Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS99-012) at:
        http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-012.asp

                        --------------- 
F) 04/21/1999 - Microsoft released a patch for the DHTML edit
vulnerability.  The DHTML edit control is an Active X control that allows
users to edit HTML text and view how it might look in a web browser.
The vulnerability results from the fact that users can be tricked into
loading and view sensitive information into the edit window and hence
upload it to the operator's web site.  Affected versions are IE version
5.0 on win95, win98 and NT 4.0 and IE 4.0 users who have downloaded the
control and are running on the following platforms: win95, win98, and
x86 version of NT 4.0.

The patch corrects the problem by allowing a web site running the safe
scripting area to upload the data only if the requesting host is in the
same domain. For more information, see the Microsoft Security Bulletin
(MS99-011) at:
        http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-011.asp

      http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html 

                        --------------- 
A) The CIH/Chernobyl virus received lots of press this past month as
April 26th came and went. The hardest hit region was the far east.
There are a number of variants of the CIH virus, some can overwrite the
hardisk and the flash BIOS of an infected computer, resulting in a
complete loss of data. Various anti-virus product vendors published
alerts concerning CIH and its variants.  For more information see the
following resources:
   http://www.avertlabs.com/public/datafiles/valerts/vinfo/spacefiller411.asp
   http://www.datafellows.com/cih/

12) QUICK TIDBITS 

A) 05/14/1999 - ssh version 1.2.27 is released.  This release includes
a number of bug fixes and enhancements. For for the full list, see the
bugtraq article at:
        http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1999_2/0476.html

                        --------------- 
B) 05/11/1999 - An article appeared on Bugtraq describing two security
vulnerabilities in INN 2.0 and higher. The first vulnerability may allow
a news user to execute arbitrary programs as root if they can control
the behavior of the inndstart program.  The solution requires a source
code change to the inndstart.c module. The second vulnerability results
>from the fact that the inndstart program is not installed in a directory
which is only accessible by the user news. The solution for this problem
requires the inndstart program to be installed in a directory with 0700
permissions.  Versions 1.7.2 and lower are not effected by both
vulnerabilities.

For more information, see the Bugtraq article at:
        http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1999_2/0431.html

                        --------------- 
C) 05/10/1999 - During the opening session of the SANS99 Technical 
Conference, Alan Paller and Rob Kolstad presented SANS Technology 
Leadership Awards to the editors of Bugtraq, NTBugtraq and the SANS

Fall of 1998, the SANS Community was asked to rate which security 
information sources provided them with the most useful information. 
The list included such publications as InfoWorld, SysAdmin, and others.  
However, the three most selected choices were write-ins. The individuals 
who received the awards were:
        Elias Levey (a.k.a Aleph1), Editor of Bugtraq
        Russ Cooper, Editor of NTBugtraq
        Michele D. Crabb-Guel, Primary editor of the SANS Digest
