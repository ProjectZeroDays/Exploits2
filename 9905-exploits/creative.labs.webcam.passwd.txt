Hi,

this is my first post to bugtraq, so excuse me if this is already known.
After a quick search through the bugtraq archives, I didn't find
anything related to this issue so I thought users should know about this.
I don't know if this belongs here after aleph's recent post about "Secure
Storage of Secrets in Windows".

The passwords for the ftp account where the images are going to be
uploaded are stored in plain text in the file /%windir%/sysdat.dll, i.e.
c:\windows\sysdat.dll and they look like this:

[Web]
FTPUserName=foo
FTPUserPWD=bar

This problem affects both versions 1.0 and 1.1 of this software.

Creative Labs Spain has been notified, and they answered they don't
support neither freeware or OEM products.
