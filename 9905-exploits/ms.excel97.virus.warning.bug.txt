Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS99-014)

Patch Available for Excel 97 Virus Warning Vulnerabilities

Originally Posted: May 7, 1999

Summary
=======
Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates vulnerabilities in the Excel
97 virus warning mechanism. The patch is fully supported, and Microsoft
recommends that affected customers download and install it, if appropriate.

Issue
=====
Microsoft Excel 97 provides a feature that warns the user before launching
an external file that could potentially contain a virus or other malicious
software. This feature allows the user to weigh the risk of opening the
file, based on its origin, the network it is located on and the security
practices in operation there, the sensitivity of the data on the user's
computer, and other factors.

However, certain scenarios have been identified that could be misused to
bypass the warning mechanism. In general, they require the use of
infrequently-combined features and commands, and are unlikely to be
encountered in normal use. This patch addresses these issues so that they
cannot be taken advantage of by a malicious user.

While there are no reports of customers being adversely affected by any of
the vulnerabilities eliminated by the patch, Microsoft is proactively
releasing the patch to allow customers to take appropriate action to protect
themselves against it. These fixes are already built into Excel 2000 and
users of that product will not need to download this patch.
