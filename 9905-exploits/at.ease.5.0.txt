<it helps when you finish your message before hitting the 'send' button>


Hello;

    At Ease 5.0 will allow a user to access any user's volume on the server.

The tested configuration is as follows:

MacOS 7.6.1 (should work with anything greater than 7)
At Ease 5.0.2
AppleShare IP 5.0.3
Netscape 4.0.7 (No reason it shouldn't work from .99 to 4.5)

How to do it.

Log in as any user that has access to Netscape Communicator, and type in
file://Macintosh%20HD/System%20Folder/ and you are able to access the disk.

Do the same thing, except use
file://At%20Ease%20Volume%20Name/At%20Ease%20%Docs/username and it's quite easy
to browse through anyones files.

It is possible to download files from that users directory. I have been unable
to actually open any of the files once they are downloaded, however in an
educational setting, just viewing names in a certian directory could constitute
some serious problems (such as if a teacher works with Special Education
studends, and has a list of documents to their parents).

Apple apparently will not fix their own product. There is a 3rd party extention
available for this at: http://www.ncal.verio.com/~lsr/programs/MSIENoServers.hqx

This is not an apple problem mostly, its an MSIE problem.

Hell, is At Ease still supported?  Its just a replacement finder as far as
I know, it doesn't do things like replace fs drivers and patch binaries to
stop things like that.
