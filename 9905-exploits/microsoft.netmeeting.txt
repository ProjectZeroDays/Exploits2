Please describe the vulnerability.
- ---------------------------------

What is the impact of this vulnerability?
- ----------------------------------------
 (For example: local user can gain root/privileged access, intruders
  can create root-owned files, denial of service attack,  etc.)

   a) What is the specific impact: Users running MS NetMeeting Version 2.1
(The one that comes
      with windows 98) software in a conference can copy/paste the remote
clipboard area.

   b) How would you envision it being used in an attack scenario:
       With the chat windows OPENED just do a CTRL-C in the box where you
       write with nothing in your box and nothing selected at all. then, you
can get
       the entire clipboard from the other user in the conference, of
course,
       if there's something in his Clipboard (ASCII, Bin, etc).


To your knowledge is the vulnerability currently being exploited?
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
 [no]

If there is an exploitation script available, please include it here.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you know what systems and/or configurations are vulnerable?
- -------------------------------------------------------------
 [yes]  (If yes, please list them below)

 System  : Windows 95, 98 and NT

Are you aware of any workarounds and/or fixes for this vulnerability?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------
 [yes] (If you have a workaround or are aware of patches
       please include the information here.)

I'm using PGP to encrypt the clipboard area.

OTHER INFORMATION
===========================================================================
Is there anything else you would like to tell us? Please, send me some
feedback abou this bug
i'm working on a solution but seems NetMeeting to use some sort of Common
Clipboard to build all
the share enviroments. If you ever heard abou this bug, please also let me
know. Thank you.
