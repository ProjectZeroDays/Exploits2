ISS Security Advisory

Multiple File System Vulnerabilities in Oracle 8

Synopsis:

Internet Security Systems (ISS) X-Force has discovered that multiple
vulnerabilities exist in Oracle 8 that may allow local attackers to exploit
weaknesses in Oracle administrative tools.  Oracle is the market leader in
enterprise database solutions. Attackers may use these vulnerabilities to
amplify their privilege to that of the 'oracle' user.  By default, the
oracle user controls the entire Oracle database system.  Attackers may
launch local denial of service attacks against the database as well as alter
or manipulate data.


Affected Versions:

ISS X-Force has determined that most current versions of Oracle 8 for Unix
are vulnerable.  These versions include 8.03, 8.04, 8.05, and 8.15.  Oracle
8 for Windows NT is not affected by these vulnerabilities.

Description:

The Oracle 8 distribution is shipped with many administrative utilities that
are owned by the oracle user with the setuid bit enabled. Several of these
utilities implement insecure file creation and manipulation.  These
utilities also trust Oracle-related environment variables.  The combined
effect of these vulnerabilities may allow local attackers to create, append
to, or overwrite privileged oracle files.  Certain vulnerabilities exist
that may allow local attackers to execute arbitrary commands as the oracle
user.  Attackers may also be able to permanently elevate their privilege to
that of the oracle user.

Temporary files that follow symbolic links are a common source of
vulnerabilities in setuid executables.  Administrators should remove or
restrict access to setuid executables if possible.

Developers of setuid programs need to take special precautions to prevent
the introduction of vulnerabilities of this nature. ISS X-Force recommends
that all Unix developers become familiar with Matt Bishop's secure
programming guide, available at
http://olympus.cs.ucdavis.edu/~bishop/secprog.html

Fix Information:

ISS X-Force has worked with Oracle to provide a patch for the
vulnerabilities described in this advisory.  Oracle has provided the
following FAQ to answer any questions concerning these vulnerabilities.

Q: I've heard about a setuid security issue with the Oracle database? What
is this all about?
A: On Unix platforms, some executable files have the setuid bit on. It may
be possible for a very knowledgeable user to use these executables to bypass
your system security by elevating their operating system privileges to that
of the Oracle user.

Q: Which releases are affected by this problem?
A: This problem affects Oracle data server releases 8.03, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, and
8.1.5 on Unix platforms only.

Q: Can I correct this problem or do I need a patch?
A: This problem can easily be corrected. The customer can download the patch
>from the Oracle MetaLink webpages at http://www.oracle.com/support/elec_sup.
The patch is a Unix shell script. This shell script should be run
immediately, and also run after each relink of Oracle.

Q: What is Oracle doing to fix this problem?
A: Effective immediately, Oracle will provide the patch on Oracle's
Worldwide Support Web pages. Oracle will ensure the patches are incorporated
into future releases of Oracle8i (8.1.6) and Oracle8.0 (8.0.6)

Q: What is Oracle doing to notify users about this problem now?
A: Oracle is notifying all supported customers, via the Oracle Worldwide
Support Web pages, of this issue so they can address it as required.

ISS X-Force also recommends that all administrators complete a proactive
survey on the use or potential misuse of setuid bits on privileged
executables on their systems.
