After installing Netscape's Directory Server 4 for Solaris, one of the final
options is to remove a file called 'install.inf' which the install process
claims could contain sensitive information. Answering yes to this question
will delete the file.

However there is another file left behind after installation which contains
the un-encrypted 'admin' password. This file has world read permissions and
is located in

/usr/netscape/server4/admin-serv/config/adm.conf

The parameter is seipid
