                 Patrol Security bugs report

   ____________________________________________________

 PROBLEM:

 The PATROL management software from BMC SOFTWARE has 3 severe bugs :

 1) Session password encryption weakness :

 The Patrol session password is protected in a way which does not prevent

 from replay attacks. It is possible for an attacker to capture (wire
 tapping, network sniffing...) an encrypted password and to provide it to
 the
 BMC API to connect to the agent. The attacker can then get a shell with
 the
 agent without the administrator to know it.

 2) Patrol frames sealing :

 The algorithm used in Patrol for sealing the frames exchanged is fairly
 weak
 (enhanced checksum). It is thus quite easy for an attacker to build a
 spoofing system which sends faked frames to an agent.

 3) Service deny on UDP port :

 The UDP ports accept connexion requests and are thus exposed to
 ping-pong
 from another UDP port (e.g. chargen).

 PLATFORM:

 Patrol agent until release 3.25 on all operating systems

   ____________________________________________________

 DAMAGE:

 You can get administrator account throught Patrol agent whithout
 accreditation or crash system by DOS attack.

 SOLUTION:

 We are actually working with BMC SOFTWARE to correct all those bugs.
