This notice concerns the Big Brother System and Network Monitor.

We noticed you downloaded a version which could be affected by
this problem so we wanted to tell you about it.

Module:   CGI History module (web/bb-hist.sh)

Affects:  Anyone who's installed the new history viewer
          bb-hist.sh as a CGI program.

Summary:  Exploiting the problem could allow the partial
          display of local files provided they are readable
