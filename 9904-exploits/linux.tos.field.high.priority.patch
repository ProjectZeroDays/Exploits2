This patch sets the tos field for IP headers to high priority and
optimizes the IP connection for throughput, which has real effects on
cisco routers.
Since it is bad policy and if hundrets of lamers use it I wont like it.
But I even more dislike hidden information, I'll let you decide wether
to publish it, but if you decide to do it, please do it anonymously.

Thanks.
