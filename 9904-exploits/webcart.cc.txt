This is my first post to Bugtraq so please bear with me for any errs and/or
misconducts.

I'd just like to point out, that Webcart is vulnerable too.

Here goes:


Mountain Network Systems Inc. http://www.mountain-net.com
Platform: ?
Exposed Directories: /config, /orders (and others. They're all listed in
config-file)
Exposed Order Info: orders.txt
Exposed Config Info: mountain.cfg
Number of exposed installs: 18+ at a quick glance. Probably more.
PGP Option Available?: Unknown
Status: Commercial, ranging from $399 to $4650.

Confirmed it, sent a heads-up to mountain-net.  Worse, look for
"import.txt" and "checks.txt"  Import.txt includes every order ever made
on the site in a tab-delimited format.

*sigh*

Sorry If already known, 1st post..

Even worse than this, check the Admin directory.. ugh.   Seems as though you
can configure the system without any type of password or authentication.
*sigh* x2
