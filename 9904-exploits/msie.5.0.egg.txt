...try it anyway.

        Heh...  try this in IE5.  Trust me the last part is good :)

        Open up IE5
        From the menu, select Tools > Internet Options > General (tab) >
Languages (button)
        Press 'Add'
        Type: "ie-ee" (without the quotes) and click 'OK'
        Move "User Defined [ie-ee]" to the TOP of the list
        Exit back to where you can browse in IE5 again
        Click on the Search icon (to pull up the side search menu)
        Laugh at the new options
Select 'Previous Searches'

Regards,
Tim Gibney

If you take the time to do this, don't forget to click on "Customize" also.
More proof that MS plans to crush Mozilla ;-)
