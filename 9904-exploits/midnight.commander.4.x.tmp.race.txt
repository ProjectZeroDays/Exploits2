Midnight Commander 4.x bugs (x2)

Still not fixed. Temporary files mc are created in insecure way, allowing
typical races. Also, entering directories containing $(...) somewhere
might result in execution of embeeded code. Described days ago, dunno why
it hasn't been patched.

4.x barely tells me anything.  Code in the 4.x can mean anything in
the last 18 months.  P

There are two major code versions:

      4.1.xx: old, stable
      4.5.xx: new, stable

I do not know of any problems in 4.5.xx.  The code does take
appropiate steps to work around those problems.

you might have described that to your shrink, or perhaps a frog
sitting on a rock, but I never saw any detailed bug reports about
this.

While Miguel de Icaza claims there's no known bugs in mc, Pavel Machek
confirmed that there are still not fixed races.

I checked out cvs of mc today, and races are gone. Owen Taylor did the
work. Is there any more problems in midnight you know of?

Yup, most of the vfs shell scripts sux
i.e.: many contain things like '> $3' unquoted.
the mc.sh example script is a perfect example of how
a script should not be written ($RANDOM is not at all a safe
way to generate temporary file names)

i tried to patch whatever i found,
all my patches to mc, if anyone cares, can be found at

Ok, at least this bit has been fixed in 4.5.30 thanks to Owen Taylor.

the mc.sh sample code is still broken.

I will look at your patches and integrate new things.

Miguel.
