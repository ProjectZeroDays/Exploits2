Subject: Re: Shopping Carts exposing CC data

Been doing some more searches for misconfigured webcarts exposing cc-information.
Seems like a pandora's box, that just opened.

Perlshop is vulnerable too if misconfigured:

Version?
Platforms?
Executable file: perlshop.cgi
Exposed directory: /store/customers/, /store/temp_customers/
Exposed orderinfo: Several files, eight-digit numbered names.
Status: adverware. Only requirement is to display a "powered by perlshop"-logo on
page.
