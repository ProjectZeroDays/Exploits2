Subject: SiteServer(SS) 3.0 Direct Mail(DM), Password in jobs

When you create a DM job in SS it creates a file at the
following location. \\Machine\TMLBQueue\Schedule\ The
file is binary with embedded UNICODE text.  If you open
the file with notepad you can see the account name and
password that the job runs under in clear text.  The
share is created when you install DM and has everyone
full control permissions.  The account that is in the
file is most likely an admin, if not a domain admin
because SS recommends a domain account to be used.

Given the general lack of quality in SS I was not
surprised to see a plain text password kicking around,
there are probably many more places.
