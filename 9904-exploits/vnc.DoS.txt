O.k I dont know if this is an really interresting thing but
when I fire up the script Mimeflood.pl on my Linux-sytems against
a Virtual Network Computing server who listens on port 5800 for incoming connection (http),
the program crashes whitin a few seconds.
A Couple of ISP here in the Netherlands use VNC-software,I guess, to let there clients
configure/control there domain.
More information on the VNC-software at www.orl.co.uk/vnc  (it`s a AT&T product)
