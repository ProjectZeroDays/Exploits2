Subject: Solaris7 and ff.core

Forgive me as I just started playing with Solaris 7 and don't recall
seeing this yet posted to Bugtraq.

It would appear as though an old bug with the OpenWeirdos File Mangler
has crept up again in Solaris 7 (I believe patch 106222-01 was supposed
to fix it back in Solaris 2.6 (and 106224-01 in Solaris 2.5.1)).  Very
basically, using ff.core it is possible for a normal user to overwrite
arbitrary files on the system (that would include things like /etc/shadow)
and do serious damage to the system (I will leave that exercise to the
reader).

Admins should remove the setuid and setgid bits from ff.core.

Regards,
Russell

That bug has never been truly fixed.  It should be fixed by Solaris
7 5/99 (hw2).  Just taking changeing the permissions on /vol will
also fix the problem.  chmod a-w /vol/*
