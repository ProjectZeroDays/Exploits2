Subject: Anyboard (www.netbula.com) problem's publicly discussed in eurohack

Draz Q published a short summary of problems with a webrelated software in
eurohack. Basicly it sounds pretty much like a common CGI problem. It
does not give user or root access, only the ability to fake/modify just
about anything showed by the program. However, in the parts left out by me
Draz Q mentiones a great many sites (including commercial sites) exposed
to the vulnarbility.

Anyboard by Netbula (www.netbula.com)

After using the Anyboard Forum at my own page (www.radikal.net/radikal)
for
a while I've found a "little" (?) flaw in it that allows _anyone_ to get
the
admin login and password. This is because the forum CFG file is available
to
anyone.

This, allows anyone to,
- Delete messages in the forum (purge the whole forum)
- Modify messages
- Write messages as Admin
- Change admin login and password
- In short, do anything in the Message forum
