Subject: javascript hotmail password trap

Hello, I was informed this morning that a free form data mailer
I maintain (http://www.tipjar.com/generic.html) was being involved
in a javascript-based hotmail password stealing scheme.

I have located the originating page (with the script) and sent it
to the contact address hotmail puts on their autoresponder documents.

I will share an URL for the (fully escaped) exploit in a week or two,
to give hotmail time to patch their systems. (that's correct procedure,
right?)

So far the perp has a few dozen passwords (and I've got them too,
they appear in my apache server log)

I have offered to send hotmail the list.  As there are many free form
data mailers around, I am not making any modifications to my tool (which
is performing correctly) which would chase the password trapper to
another form mailer whose admin does not keep as good of logs.

The page with the script on it contains a warning that your password
has just been trapped; so unless there are other copies of this script
running around all the victims know it already.

ha ha.

No, it wasn't a traditional password trap (like yours) but
a javascript which takes advantage of cookie-based security
hooks to contact hotmail's database and change your password.
