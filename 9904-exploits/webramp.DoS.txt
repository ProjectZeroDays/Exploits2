ISS Security Advisory -- WebRamp Denial of Service Attacks
March 31, 1999

Synopsis:

Ramp Networks (http://www.rampnet.com/) WebRamp Internet access devices
allow multiple computers to share a dialup connection. The WebRamp family
of Internet access devices are designed for small businesses that require
cost-effective, high-speed Internet access on every desktop.

WebRamp is vulnerable to two denial of service attacks that allow an
attacker to either crash the WebRamp device or change its IP address.
When the device crashes, it will have to be manually reset before
it will dial up. If an attacker changes the IP address of the WebRamp,
none of the machines on your network will be able to find it, so no
machines will be able to access the Internet via the WebRamp. The device
will still function as a network hub, so your intra-LAN connectivity will
not be disrupted.


Description:

WebRamp crash/denial of service attack: Sending a specially formatted string
of characters to the HTTP port of the WebRamp causes the device to hang,
requiring a manual reset.

WebRamp IP address change: Sending a specially-formatted UDP packet to port
5353 changes the WebRamp's local IP address, effectively 'hiding' the
device from the rest of your machines. The WebRamp is still connected to
the Internet and its PPP IP address is unchanged.

Recommendations:

If an attacker has crashed your WebRamp, then manually reset it by turning
it off and on again.

If an attacker has changed the IP address, use WRFINDER.EXE on the WebRamp
installation CD to change the address to a proper value.


Fix Information:

Go to http://www.rampnet.com/upgrades to get the latest firmware for your
model of WebRamp.


Additional Information:

Information in this advisory was obtained by the research of Jon Larimer
<jlarimer@iss.net> of the ISS X-Force. ISS X-Force would like to thank
Ramp Networks <http://www.rampnet.com> for their assistance with testing
on WebRamp devices and providing fix information.
