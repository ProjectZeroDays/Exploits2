Subject: AOL Instant Messenger URL Crash

There is a bug in the newer versions of AOL's Instant Messenger that will
cause the client to crash when exploited.  All builds of version 2.0 that
I've tested seem to be vulnerable, although I have not done extensive
version testing.  AOL was notified of this about two weeks ago.  To exploit
this bug, send a hyperlink in this format: aim:addbuddy?=screenname

Have fun,

I just sent <a href="aim:addbuddy?=screenname">what does this show up as</a>?
to an AOL AIM 2.0.996 user and once she *clicked* on it AIM crashed. I don't
know if you meant to say that the user had to click on it for the client to
crash, or if this is indeed different behaviour. I also just tried it with
"screenname" replaced with first her screenname, and then with mine, again
with no automatic reaction.

(sent from linuxkitty, a naim-0.9.4-parse2 user, to <victim>, an AOL AIM
2.0.996 user)
[15:59:43] linuxkitty: [LINK:href="aim:addbuddy?=screenname":what
does this show up as]?
[16:00:23] Friend <victim> has just logged off :(
[16:03:09] Friend <victim> is now online =)
[16:14:14] linuxkitty: [LINK:href="aim:addbuddy?=<victim>":miaow
miaow] (don't click on that, I'm just testing something)
[16:14:50] linuxkitty: [LINK:href="aim:addbuddy?=linuxkitty":anoth

I'm sorry if I was unclear in my first post.  The only way I've seen to
exploit this is to send someone a hyperlink in the form of
aim:addbuddy?=screenname and have them click on it.  (replacing "screenname"
with an actual screen name seems to give the same result)  You can also set
up a web page that will redirect your victim to a client crashing URL once
they've caught on to your evil little scheme. :p  I set up an example of
this at http://www.fazed.net/poof for testing purposes, of course.

I haven't been able to duplicate this on any 2.0.8* builds...I've tested about
15 different people and none in the 2.0.8* builds were affected.

All others tested were in the 2.0.9* build and died immediately, some causing
the user to have to reboot, all rendering AIM completly unable to be restarted
for several minutes after the Dr. Watson cleared on NT.

The problem could not be duplicated on AIM 2.0.813 (Windows 98) running IE
5.0 - Is it possible that this is in part a problem with IE 4.0?

This doesn't seem to work on the Mac versions (tested 2.01.644)
