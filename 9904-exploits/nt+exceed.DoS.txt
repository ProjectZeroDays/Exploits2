Subject: NT/Exceed D.O.S.

This is regarding Hummingbird's Exceed X emulator v5 (and possibly v6)
running on Windows NT.  I haven't tested Win95/98.

The Exceed X server allows inbound TCP connections on port 6000 from the XDM
host.  If someone uses telnet from the XDM host to connect to a PC running
Exceed on port 6000 and enters any garbage text, the X server will hang and
the Exceed session is frozen for good.

I have notified Hummingbird via their tech support web site but have not
received a response yet.

As far as I know, a variation of that bug has been present in all versions
>from the early Exceed for MS-Dos onwards.  I stumbled on it 5 years ago when
I was a student, so I didn't know whether it was a configuration error or a
bug.
I don't think I managed to permanently freeze the connection then, but it
was certainly possible to freeze it for as long as you left the telnet
connection to port 6000 open.  If I remember correctly, it didn't use to
be just the XDM host that could make the connection, you could freeze Exceed
>from any host.  I guess that would depend on the setting of the 'Host Access
Control List' field.

For the record, I've just tested Exceed v6 under Windows 98 and it still has
the same effect.  I also tested setting Exceed to only allow a given machine
to connect, and I can still freeze it by telnetting from another machine
in another subnet...
I didn't manage to freeze it beyond the telnet session to port 6000 though.

I wasn't able to duplicate a mini-DOS running eXceed 6.0.2.0 on NT 4.0 SP4.

Steps:
On NT machine, opened xterm session
Went to box that I just opened the session with, type in TELNET <my_ip_addr> 6000
The eXceed program hung for about 2 minutes as the host tried to connect to it, but everything else still worked in NT.
After attempting to connect, it will say it is connected for about 2 seconds and then states "Connection closed by foreign
host".
After that the eXceed session resumed and I was able to close out gracefully.

I just tested Exceed v6.0 under Win95, and it is vulnerable.

Exceed (an X server, not an X emulator) version 6.0.1.0 on NT appears to
have fixed this problem, somewhat...

Telnetting to port 6000 locks the server up for 20-30 seconds, but it
recovers eventually.  Not surprisingly, using netcat has the same effect...
although, contrary to Chris's findings with Exceed 5, I didn't need to send
any garbage characters, the connection alone did the job.  Also, it works
>from any host, not just the one the xdm session had been initiated with,
regardless of host access settings in Xconfig, Exceeds "configuration" tool.


I'd still consider this DoS-bait, when you imagine a one-liner to
continuously connect to port 6000 of your favorite Exceed user's machine.

I couldn't reproduce either effect with Exceed 6.1 under NTsp3.
Everything behaved normally, both for new and existing sessions.

Jamie,

Ditto for 6.1 on Win95.  Appears to be fixed in 6.1, among other bugs,
including an incompatibility with DEC Windows that was causing problems at
my shop.

This seems to have been fixed at some point, connecting and/or spewing
random data to exceedhost 6000-6010 has no discenrible effect on exceed
6.1.0 under win98 or NTsp4.

A denial of service is still possible though: Exceed defaults to allowing
128 connections from the xdm host, but counts a telnet connection as though
it were a connection from a valid X client.  Once the max number of
connections is reached, subsequent attempts to the X port range are refused.
