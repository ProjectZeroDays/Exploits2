Run/compile the code in the invitee directory of this exploit first!
Then run/compile ircdexp in this directory.  It should connect 2 clients
to 2 irc servers (one being trivial, the other being the ircd hybrid-6
server).  It will then invite the 3rd client (name 'clientccc' by
default), thus completing the exploit.
