Details

Software: Stop User Enumeration
Version: 1.3.8
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-user-enumeration/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/stop-user-enumeration-rest-api/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Description
================
Stop User Enumeration allows user enumeration via the REST API

Vulnerability
================
Stop User Enumeration optionally allows stopping user enumeration via the WordPress REST API. When that option is enabled, requests toA /wp-json/wp/v2/users are blocked and return an error like this:
{\"code\":\"rest_cannot_access\",\"message\":\"Only authenticated users can access the User endpoint REST API.\",\"data\":{\"status\":401}}
It also successfully blocks requests such asA /?rest_route=/wp/v2/users.
The blocking relies upon the following comparison:
if( preg_match(\'/users/\', $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\']) !== 0 ) {
On the surface this looks like it should work.A And itA seems like we canat get around the restriction by sending a POST request with the parameter rest_route=/wp/v2/users, because WordPress thinks we want to create a user and responds with an error.
However, the REST API allows simulating differentA request types. As such, we can perform a POST request with the ausersa string in the body of the request, and tell the REST APIA to act like itas received a GET request.

Proof of concept
================
curl http://localhost/?_method=GET -d rest_route=/wp/v2/users

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to versionA 1.3.9 or later.
