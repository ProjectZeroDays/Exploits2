Version: 3.0.15
Homepage: https://themeforest.net/item/salutation-responsive-wordpress-buddypress-theme/548199
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/stored-xss-salutation-theme/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 4.9 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Stored XSS in Salutation Responsive WordPress + BuddyPress Theme could allow logged-in users to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
The theme contains JavaScript (assets/js/onLoad.js) whichA iterates through .section-tabs aA and puts every href value it finds into jQuery(). jQuery() doesnat just search for elements which match a selector (i.e. jQuery(\'.section-tabs\')), it also creates elements (i.e. jQuery(\'<div>\')).
$(\'.section-tabs\').simpleSlideTop();

// ...

$.fn.simpleSlideTop = function(opts) {

    // ...

    contentID = $(this).attr(\'href\');

    $(contentID).hide();
An attacker without the unfiltered_htmlA capability would be able to inject arbitrary HTML as if they had the unfiltered_htmlA capability.A With the ability to inject arbitrary HTML, the attacker is ableA add JavaScript which causes a logged-in administrator user to do almost anything a including creating new user accounts, deleting posts, and more.

Proof of concept
================

Click the activate button on the theme
Install and activate Revolution Slider plugin
Create a new user with role ofA Author (by default, Authors do not possess the unfiltered_html capability)
Log in as that user
Visit aAdd New Posta screen
Switch the editor to aTexta mode
Enter the following:A <div class=\"section-tabs\"><a href=\"&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;\">a</a></div>
PressA aPublisha
Press aView posta
You will see an alertbox appear showing the value a1a

For comparison,A if the same user account entersA <img src=x onerror=alert(1)> or <script>alert(1)</script>, it will be blocked by WordPress.

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to versionA 3.0.16 or later.
