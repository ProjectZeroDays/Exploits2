The vulnerability is related to the insufficient filtration in HTMLawed. Existing filter can be bypassed and paste into the HTML tag <img> onerror event, that leads to stored XSS.

I notified the developers of existing vulnerabilities and they closed it in version 2.1.1

vulnerable versions:
2.0 to 2.1.1
maybe 1.* versions

my XSS exploit:
<img alt="<img onerror=alert(1)//"<">
