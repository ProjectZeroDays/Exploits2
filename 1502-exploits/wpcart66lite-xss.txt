## Description: 
================================================================
Cart66 is a simple to use yet powerful ecommerce plugin for WordPress. Sell digital products 
and/or physical products with Cart66. The easiest to use WordPress ecommerce shopping cart plugin.


## Reflected XSS
================================================================
The plugin suffers from a reflected cross site scripting in the file orders.php
which is loaded in /wp4/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cart66_admin by viewing the orders.
The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a logged in admin to click an URL


## PoC
================================================================
The vulnerable parameter is called "status". The "status" parameter is retrieved from a $_GET['status'] call
But is not further sanitized before printing the variable. 

The vulnerability can be exploited using the following link:

/wp4/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cart66_admin&status=</script><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>

## Solution
================================================================
Update to version 1.5.5.
