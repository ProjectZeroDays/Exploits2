When manipulating the referer header by putting in javascript: it will be rendered on the admin page within the referers list as a a href attribute. When admin (or above author level) clicks on it the XSS gets executed.

Tags get stripped so it's not possible to execute the XSS directly on load. Single and double quotes are escaped, but can be worked around. Example:

Referer: javascript:c=String.fromCharCode;alert(c(83)+c(117)+c(109)+c(79)+c(102)+c(80)+c(119)+c(110)+c(46)+c(110)+c(108))



The referer list shows the top 20. But its easy to get your attack referer in the top by just looping with unique x-forwarded-for ip's. By default referers are stored (but can be turned off in the settings of the plugin). Up to 150 chars of the referer are stored (can be changed to 500 max).
