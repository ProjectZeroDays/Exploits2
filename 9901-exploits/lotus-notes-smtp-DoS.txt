Subject: Lotus Notes SMTP Server bug

There is a security bug in IBM's Lotus Notes SMTP server. eg. An SMTP
session:

helo a
250 notes.foo.com
helo b
500 Session already established. The domain name [b] passed in with HELO
will be ignored. The current domain name of sending SMTP is [a].

If the strings `a' and `b' are very long (2048 chars), the Notes
SMTP server starts consuming CPU and crashes. A remote denial-of-
service. No workaround is known to me.

The bug exists with Notes on both Solaris and Windows platforms.

PS: This is not related to the gethostbyname() bug in Solaris 2.5.
