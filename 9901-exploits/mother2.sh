# those other two bitches are dumb as fuck for
# even sending this to the public and actually
# making a huge prop header as if it was some sort
# of rad finding they discovered.

# Well, this REALLY finds all setuid and setgid programs.

# mother.sh did not work and was asuming your home
# dir was /root and uhm tha doesnt even matter, the script
# did NOT even fucking work... learn if and fi dumb bitches.
# btw, it was made by Nickelby/PureDead, the dorks of 99.
