   RAPING BANDWIDTH

   The process of using up someones website bandwidth in a useless
   fashion. Lo-tech, but it does the job.


   WHY?

   Because some people deserve it and in some circumstances it can be a
   useful way to use up your own bandwidth when you havn't used up your
   20 gig download limit on your cable modem. These lamers often have
   their sites hosted on such elite servers as geocities and angelfire.
   They will not tolerate a pathetic site full of vulgar language sucking
   up their bandwidth and will likely kick the site. Or if the offending
   site is hosted on some space that came with the victims crummy dial-up
   account there will be tight restrictions and you can burn up their
   allowed downloads in a matter of days if not hours. Alternatively
   you'll push them over the limit and they will have to pay for the
   bandwidth that you suck.


   METHOD #1

   This will only be effective if you have a very popular website.

   Find a large image on your victims site. Note: Lamers are expert at
   making bloated crappy graphics so finding a large one should be easy.
   Put a link to it at the bottom of your leet site's most popular page.
   Like so:

   <IMG SRC="http://www.lameserver.com/leet/crap.jpg" WIDTH="0" HEIGHT="0">

   Make sure you have the width and height set to zero so your guests
   don't have to waste their eye-time looking at ugly grafix. Now every
   hit to your page will be indirectly a hit to their fat graphic and
   their bandwidth is duly sucked.


   METHOD #2

   You're obviously going to need some fat bandwidth yourself for this
   method. But like I said, when you have 20 gigs to burn up you might
   as well put it to good use.

   Find a large image on your victims site.

   Make sure you set your browsers cache to zero and to check for newer 
   versions everytime it hits the page. Create a file similar to the
   following and run it on your machine. Or run it somewhere else for a
   more anonymous approach. For example you could load it on a geocities
   account and run it from there.

   Filename = "rapedem.html"

   <HTML>
   <HEAD>
   <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="3; URL=rapedem.html">
   </HEAD>
   <BODY>
   <IMG SRC="http://www.lameserver.com/leet/crap.jpg">
   </BODY>
   </HTML>

   Impact:

   Ok, say the graphic you're raping is 50k. How long will it take to
   make a significant dent reloading every three seconds?

    1,000 kb/minute
   60,000 kb/hour
     1.44 Mb/day

   Run just seven instances of this baby and you can burn up 10 Mb in
   a day. Get your friends to run it too and make your victim feel the
   burn.


   WELL

   Nice and simple and best of all this is perfectly legal. No damage
   to files. No unauthorized access. I guess you could call it an
   "abundance of service" attack as opposed to a "denial of service"
   attack.


   Eee-Ohh-Eff
