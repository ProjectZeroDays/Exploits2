Subject: sun "encryption" lameness

I was checking out my new fangled desktop in solaris 7. or 2.7 what ever
they are calling it, and i Stumbled across a buttion that said "Encrypt
file". I was like shit... I took a swig from my 40oz of colt 45 and
"encrpyted" a plain textfile

overlord:/morph.home/matt$ cat > lame.ass
NO SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL

overlord:/morph.home/matt$ ls -al lame.ass
-rw-r--r--   1 matt     users         100 Jan 14 23:11 lame.ass

[after "encrypting" ]

overlord:/morph.home/matt$ cat lame.ass
uudecode -p <<"endCrypt" | crypt "$1"
begin 644 Crypted
:.FXF8Z!U8(ZU#2;.;K#.LCE8N@5K^^3%,?(8

end

You know what to do from here....

Matt
