Subject: [SECURITY] ftpwatch package has major security problems

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

We have found that the ftpwatch package as distributed in Debian
GNU/Linux 1.3 and later distributions has a security problem which makes
it trivial for users to gain root access.

We recommend that you remove the ftpwatch package immediately.

We will be working on a new version of ftpwatch to address these issues and
will announce that in a new advisory.
