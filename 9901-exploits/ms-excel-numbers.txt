Subject: Excel bug

I imagine this has been discussed some, but in case it hasn't.
If you enter a number, say 123456789999 in Excel and save the file as
comma delimited (csv I think MS uses) it will be saved as 1.234567E+11.
Quite a few programs can't import this properly, including Word.
But what's worse, bringing it back into Excel gives you 123456700000.
I think the risks are fairly obvious.
I wonder if the large bank I work for (which has standardized on
Excel) knows about it.
When opening an account I guess not only do I need to ask banks the
interest rates, fees etc, but also what software they use. Sheesh.
