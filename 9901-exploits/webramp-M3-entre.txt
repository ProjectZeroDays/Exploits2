You obviously can't do anything interesting with the CLI unless you have
the password.  However, the WebRamp (at least Entre, the ISDN version,
which is what I use) includes a default username of "wradmin" and password
of "trancell."  This gives you full access to the device, either through
the CLI or the Windows management software (which seems to use the CLI).

You can use the CLI to set up a "Remote Office" connection profile.  If
you do this, you can make the WebRamp call up a remote site and attach it
to your network.  Or, you could change the ISP phone number to something
else, and thereby get the WebRamp to divulge your password.  Other uses
for this access are pretty obvious.

The real security issue is the presence of the default password, the
documentation's lack of insistence on changing it, and the
difficulty/impossibility of restricting access to the CLI.

Our experiences with Ramp Network's tech support, on other issues, have
been less than ideal.
