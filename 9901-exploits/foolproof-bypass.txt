      FoolProof found to be full of security glitches

      FoolProof a product by SmartStuff was intentionally programed to stop users from increasing
      computer maintaince (by installing new software, changing the current computer
      configuration and so on) by limiting the functions a user can do. The mentioned product was
      found to have a lot of security glitches making it possible to bypass FoolProof's security
      mechanism.

      A group of users posted a few ways to bypass the security mechanism:
      1) Boot up in Safe Mode bypasses FoolProof's TSR making it possible for the user to delete
      the FoolProof's directory.
      2) Holding the <SHIFT> key under Macintosh prevents FoolProof's module from loading.
      3) Creating a copy of 'command.com' with the name of 'temp.txt' (for example), then opening
      it up with wordpad, and saving it as 'c:\windows\help\wordpad.hlp' (make sure you don't
      convert the file), then simply click on the HELP feature under the START menu, and you will
      be dropped into dos.
      4) Use the 'echo' command to overwrite FoolProof's files (i.e. execute the following command
      'echo Hi > c:\fool95\fooltsr.exe', 'fool95' stands for the directory FoolProof is installed in).
      5) Grab the administrator password by locating it in the swap file crated by Windows 95. You
      can accomplish this by simply finding the string 'FOOLPROO', and the string after that will be
      the administrator password.
