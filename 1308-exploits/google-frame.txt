I reported this problem to Google in June but I did not get the usual reply
saying they were working on it, so I guess it isn't serious enough to be
fixed.

The problem is the page for requesting access to a private document. It
does not have any protection against being framed, so you can make a
private document, trick someone into clicking the button to request access
and get an email from Google Docs with their full name and email address.

<p>This only works if you are logged in to Google. In an actual exploit, the Google Docs frame would be completely transparent. Do not click the button unless you like sending your personal information to strangers on the internet.</p>
