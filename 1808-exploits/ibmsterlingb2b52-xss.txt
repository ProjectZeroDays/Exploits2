Vulnerability Name : Persistent Cross Site Scripting 
Affected Parameter(s) : fname & lname
 
Steps to reproduce
Step 1 : Login to the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.
 
Step 2 : Navigate to Performance Tuning module, Username will be displayed as below :- 
                Last Edited By <USERNAME>
    Note :- Modify the configuration for example and check the Last Edited By - Username. Any user (Admin or Non admin) who have privileges to change the configuration can act like an attacker. 
 
Step 3 : Navigate to My Account and update first name and last name.
 
Step 4: Intercept the request using burp suite and insert the <Video><source onerror=aalert(1)a> payload & <Video><source onerror=aalert(2)a> payload in fname and lname parameter.
 
Step 5 : It has been observed that My account module is not vulnerable to XSS but Performance Tuning tab under Operations -> Performance is vulnerable, as the Performance Tuning tab displays the useras first name and last name separately as aLast Edited By USERNAMEa.
 
Step 6 : Now navigate to Performance Tuning module. It is seen that the application is vulnerable to Persistent Cross Site Scripting.
 
Note : It has been observed that any user who has access to Performance Tuning tab will be vulnerable and the same javascript payload will execute for them as well.
