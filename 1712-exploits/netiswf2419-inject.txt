 HTML Injection in Netis-WF2419



Netis-WF2419 is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails
to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML or script code could run in the context of the
affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based
authentication credentials and control how the site is rendered to the
user; other attacks are also possible.

Netis-WF2419 is vulnerable;

Proof of Concept:
