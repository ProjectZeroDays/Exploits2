Subject:      Trojan Horse Guard - Cassandra GOLD Release.

Uppsala, Sweden the 23rd of July 1999


Dear fellow Bugtraq readers,
I am proud to present the Gold version of Cassandra.
Cassandra is a free Trojan Horse Guard which has the ability to detect and remove 25 different Trojan Horses.


The first version was apparantly greatly appreciated by the public. It didn't get a lot of publicity except for a link in Aleph Ones BO2K mail.
But despite this, Cassandra was downloaded over 1 400 times in 7 days. 


I want to thank all of you who have given me advice, corrected me, reported bugs, supplied me with mirrors etc. You have all been very helpful, thankyou.

I hope this tool will be of use in your everyday fight against Trojans.


Yours sincerely
Jonathan James
