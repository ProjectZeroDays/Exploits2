*Product
Description---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
Jira (stylized JIRA) is a proprietary issue tracking product, developed by
Atlassian. It provides bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management
functions. Although normally styled JIRA, the product name is not an
acronym, but a truncation of Gojira, the Japanese name for Godzilla, itself
a reference to JIRA's main competitor, Bugzilla. It has been developed
since 2002. Artezio Board is a simple and user-friendly Kanban board plugin
for JIRA.

*Steps to Reproduce:*


*Attack Scenario: Stored Cross Site Scripting and Sensitive Information
Disclosure* Step 1. Login into JIRA v6.4
Step 2: Go to More -> Boards.
Step 3: Click on Create New Board tab -> Create New
Step 4: Insert XSS payload in "Board Name" parameter of Create New Board. I
have used "><img src=x onerror=prompt(1);> XSS
payload
Step 5: Then click on Ok
Step 6: Whenever anyone try to edit or refresh page, the alert XSS Script
will get execute and also disclosing sensitive information on the page like
Users Details, IDs, Status etc.

*Impact of attack:* An attack can perform Cross Site Scripting attack and
steal the cookie of other active sessions. An attacker would exploit a
vulnerability within a website or web application that the victim would
visit, essentially using the vulnerable website as a vehicle to deliver  a
malicious script to the victimâ€™s browser.
An attacker might be able to put stored XSS into the website.

*Recommendation:* Use an appropriate combination of white listing and
blacklisting to ensure only valid and expected input is processed by the
system. Furthermore, classes within the output tag libraries should also be
modified to encode potentially dangerous characters with their HTML escape
Counter parts.

Kindly find attached screenshot (POC) for the same.
