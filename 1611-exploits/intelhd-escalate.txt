[#] Technical Details & Description:
====================================
The application suffers from a search path issue unquoted impact on Intel(R) HD Graphics. This could potentially allow
authorized but unprivileged local user accounts with system access to unauthorized execute arbitrary code with system 
privileges of the affected software process.

The security risk of the software vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.4. 
Exploitation of the software vulnerability requires a low privilege system user account with restricted access and without user interaction. 
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in system process compromise and further manipulation or exploitation to compromise the 
local computer operating system.


[#] Proof of Concept (PoC):
===========================
The issue can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account or network access and without user interaction.
