Dear Community

By comparing the advisory of NextCloud and OwnCloud I figured out that OwnCloud has multiple not patched vulnerabilities.

You can see list here it seems all patches missing from latest Nextcloud 10.0.1 release in OwnCloud: https://nextcloud.com/security/advisories. This seems to include XSS vulns and more.

An example exploit for one of the vulns would look like that: http://demo.owncloud.org/index.php/apps/gallery/#<script>alert(document.domain)</script>/%00

And also RhinosSecurity seem to have blogged about unfixed vulns in OwnCloud: https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/2016/10/operation-ownedcloud-exploitation-post-exploitation-persistence/i>>?

Hope that OwnCloud fixes this soon!

Cheers
