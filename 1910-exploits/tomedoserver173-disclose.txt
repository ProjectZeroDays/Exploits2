Vulnerability Details:
The Customer’s Tomedo Server in Version 1.7.3 communicates to the Vendor Tomedo Server via HTTP (in cleartext) that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
Basic authentication is used for the authentication what’s makes it possible to base64 decode the sniffed credentials and get hold of the username and password.

Proof of concept:
Capture the traffic between the Tomedo servers via a proxy or a MITM attack and base64 decode the credentials from the HTTP GET request.
