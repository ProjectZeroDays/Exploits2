Details:
========
A client side cross site scripting web vulnerability is detected in Googles DoubleClick company web application service.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to form manipulated urls to inject script code on client side application requests.

The client side cross site scripting web vulnerability is located in the license section when processing to request the 
login file form via GET with a manipulated ff (value) parameter.  

Exploitation of the vulnerability does not require a privileged application user account but low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation results in client side cross site requests, unauthorized external redirects, client side phishing, 
client side session hijacking and client side module context manipulation.

Vulnerable Service(s):
				[+] Avira - Licenses (https://license.avira.com)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] login

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] ff


Proof of Concept:
=================
The cross site web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account and with low or medium user interaction.

Solution:
=========
Input should be validated as strictly as possible on arrival and user input should be secure encoded with html special chars at any point 
where the context gets copied into application response.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the client side cross site scripting web vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
