2012-11-02:	Vendor Notification
2013-05-05:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Sony
Product: PSN Community - Lithium Forums 2012 Q4


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are located in Sony`s official PSN Community Website Application.
The bug allows remote attackers with low account privileges to inject via editor & replace function own malicious 
persistent script codes. The vulnerabilities are located in the forum editor module with the replace function and the 
bound vulnerable message titel, subject and link parameters. Remote attackers can compose malicious forum posts to 
hijack psn admin/moderator/customer accounts. Successful exploitation result in persistent web context manipulation, 
application side phishing, persistent malware loads, external redirects or persistent session hijacking via forum messages.


Vulnerable Section(s):
				[+] Skype Community (Forums) - Lithium Forum

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Editor (in combination with the replace all function to execute)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Message Subject, Topic Title & Link Widget


Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low or medium required user inter action and with low privileged 
psn application service user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...
