Hello:

I think I have found some kind of bug in "su" in Redhat linux versions(
tested on Redhat 5.2 y Redhat 6.0 )

The problem seems to be when you logon into a Redhat system, with normal
user priviledges( sample patowc: uid 512 gid 512 ) and enter a superuser
session with "su".

In that moment superuser kills your "su" session( kill -9 ) and it seems
as the session is killed, but when you try to continue working randomly
you get superuser priviledges again, and randomly you get into normal
user priviledges...

I think the problem could be in two points, in the way "su" manages the
KILL signal, or in the way it works with the tty.

'Cause i have no time to investigate this, I think it could be
interesting for you...

Thx for your time...

Greets
