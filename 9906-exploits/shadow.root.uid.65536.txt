Subject: UID 65536 and shadow-19990307

Recently one of our admins installed the shadow-19990307 package.
While playing around I noticed that if a new user is created with UID 65536,
he will become root upon login. No root login will be logged, and even if
the tty isn't in /etc/securetty he will be allowed in.
I dont think this is normal behaviour :)
