Subject: Vulnerability in Broker FTP Server v. 3.0 Build 1

Hi,

I've found a vulnerability in Broker FTP Server v. 3.0 Build 1. Here's an
example:

You have it installed with FTP root in c:\FTProot and you have a user
"test" with home directory in c:\FTProot\test. You also have checked the
"Display as ROOT directory" checkbox for test, so he/she can't get below
the home directory. CWD won't take him/here below it, but LIST will:

LIST ..\..\winnt\

will list the contents of c:\winnt and

NLST ..\..\winnt\

will also list the contents of c:\winnt. Of course this isn't as bad as if
CWD or RETR had worked, but you probably don't want anybody to be able to
look around in your private directories... I've contacted Transsoft about
this, and they should have released a new version that fixed this more than
a week ago. I've contacted them again but they haven't given me a reply
this time.
