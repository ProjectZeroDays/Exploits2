Subject: Netscape Fasttrack 3.01 allows directory listing

Hi all,

I recently have downloaded a trial version of Fasttrack server (3.01) for NT

According to Netscape documentation:

----8<------------------------8<-------------------8<---
Specifying index filenames

If a document name is not specified in the URL,
and the server finds a file with this name in a
document directory, it assumes that file is the
index file. The server automatically displays this
file when no specific file is requested. The defaults
are index.html and home.html. If more than
one name is specified, the server looks in the
order in which the names you specified appear
until one is found. For example, if your index
filenames are index.html, home.html, the
server first looks for index.html, and if the
server doesn't find it, then the server looks for
home.html.

------8<--------------8<---------------8<--------------------

Well, having this configuration:

Index Filenames: index.html

Directory indexing: fancy or simple

and HAVING a index.html file in root directory

 if you telnet to default httpd port and type:

get /  (lowercase)

You will get a directory listing of the root directory.

Workaround: Disable directory listing.

Netscape has been notified.

Hi,

Keith R. Jarvis has found the same issue in
http://geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1998_1/0092.html

After more than one year Netscape don´t warm their customers about this
security flaw.

In http://www.netscape.com/security/notes/index.html, are the "current and
previous security notes [...] concerning the security of our client, server,
and development software".

No comment :(

This same thing works on FastTrack 3.5 for Netware.
You can also put any directory name after the / to see what's in the lower directories.
