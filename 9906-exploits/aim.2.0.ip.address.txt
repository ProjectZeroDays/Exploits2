Exploit in the newest AIM 2.0

In the newest version of AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) there is a way to
transfer files. When you are transferring the file, you can open a DOS
prompt and type:

netstat -a -n

By doing this you (obviously) can get the person's IP address. Usually it
will be on port 5190. This may seem pointless because usually not much can
be done with simply an IP address, but under certain circumstances this can
be useful.

Folks, the reason this is an issue is because until now AIM
was anonymous in as much as the client IP was never disclosed
to other clients. All communication between clients in AIM
was handled via an intermediary server. This breaks that
anonymity which is a shame. Anyone who is been on IRC can
attest to the harassment one can come under by someone else
just by them knowing your IP address.
