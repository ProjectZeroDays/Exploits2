1.  Bulletins Topics

    Sun announces the release of patches for Solaris(tm) 2.6 and 2.5.1
    (SunOS 5.6 and 5.5.1) containing Sun's implementation of 
    version 8.8.8 sendmail.

    Sun recommends that customers running SunOS 5.6 and 5.5.1 install the 
    patches listed in section 4 to take advantage of the security 
    enhancements found in version 8.8.8 sendmail.

2.  Understanding What is Available
        
    sendmail is a mail transfer agent, Copyright (C) Eric Allman and the
    University of California, which is freely available.  Their base version
    is commonly known as "Berkeley sendmail", as opposed to various vendors'
    versions of sendmail (including Sun's).  SunOS 5.6 and 5.5.1 originally 
    included version 8.6.9 of Berkeley sendmail, with Sun enhancements
    added.
    
    Various security related improvements were made in version 8.8.8 of 
    Berkeley sendmail, including improvements relating to email spam and
    bombs, and email relaying.  Sun's implementation of version 8.8.8 sendmail
    includes enhancements to address subsequently identified security 
    vulnerabilities and support for V1/Sun configuration files, used in 
    Sun's version of 8.6.9 sendmail.
    
3.  Support for Sun's sendmail
    
    With this release of version 8.8.8 sendmail, Sun will stop support
    for version 8.6.9 sendmail for SunOS 5.6 and 5.5.1.
        
4.  List of Patches

    Sun's implementation of version 8.8.8 sendmail is provided for SunOS 5.6 
    and 5.5.1 via these patches:
