Affected Product(s):
====================
Product: MP3 Cutter v1.1.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A Reverse Enginering Vulnerability has been discovered in the official MP3 Cutter v1.1.0 software.

An attacker could make the software completely free MP3 Cutter manipulating conditoinel jumps and bypass security registration code to back any password and validated registration.

Vulnerable Input(s):
			[+] Registration Code


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
A Reverse Enginering Vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with low privileged system user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Debug MP3 Cutter.exe
2. Find the string "Invaild Serial Code"
3. Replace the conditional jump "JMP" in "JNZ"
4. Save the changes made and save the executable
5. Run the software you have changed
6. Click "Register MP3 Cutter now"
7. Enter any code in "Input Registration Code" eg 12345 and click "OK"
8. BOOMM Registration Hijacked.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the reverse engineering vulnerability in the software core is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.0)
