Vulnerability description :

For a client program to be able to connect to the MySQL server, 
it must use the proper connection parameters, 
such as the name of the host where the server is running and 
the user name and password of your MySQL account. 
This file contains full/partial source code that contains 
a mysql_connect/mysql_pconnect function call that includes 
the MySQL connection credentials. This information 
is highly sensitive and should not be found on a production system.
