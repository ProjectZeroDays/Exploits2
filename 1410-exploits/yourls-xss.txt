Hello, I found a xss stored vulnerability in Yourls 1.7 script (latest
version).

The attacker can steal the admin's cookies and login in the admin panel.

Note: Only the admin can see this.

Steps to perform the vulnerability:

1. Create a new url to shorten --> In the inputs you need write this
payload --> anything"><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>*

* Javascript code to inject.

2. Click in the button "Shorten"

3. Wait until the administrator logs in the admin panel
