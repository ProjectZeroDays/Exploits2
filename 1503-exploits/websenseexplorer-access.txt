When a scheduled report has run, the report file is sent to recipients as an email attachment. Scheduled reports are also saved within explorer_wse, which is accessible for unauthenticated users. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated (proxy) users to download resources from the Websense reporting folder. Including confidential Web Security incidents reports Websense Explorer configuration files. For example:
