Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was discovered that Citrix Command Center stores configuration files
containing credentials of managed devices within a folder accessible
through the web server. Unauthenticated attackers can download any
configuration file stored in this folder, decode passwords stored in
these files, and gain privileged access to devices managed by Command
Center.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested version
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue was discovered in Citrix Command Center 5.1 build 33.3
(including patch CC_SP_5.2_40_1.exe), other versions may also be
vulnerable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Citrix reports that this vulnerability is fixed in Command Center 5.2
build 42.7, which can be downloaded from the following location (login

Configuration files can be downloaded from the conf web folder. Below is an example of a configuration file that can be obtained this way.

https://<target>:8443/conf/securitydbData.xml

This files contains encoded passwords, for example:

<DATA ownername="NULL" password="C70A0eE9os9T2z" username="root"/>

These passwords can be decoded trivially. The algorithm used can be found in the JAR file NmsServerClasses.jar. For example the encoded password C70A0eE9os9T2z decodes to SECURIFY123. The credentials stored in these files can than be used to gain privileged access to devices managed by Command Center.
