Subject: Linux /usr/bin/gnuplot overflow

greetings,

INFO:

There is a local root comprimise in /usr/bin/gnuplot version Linux version 3.5
(pre 3.6) patchlevel beta 336.  gnuplot is shipped to install suidroot on
SuSE 5.2 and maybe others.  The exploit starts as a simple $HOME buffer
overflow, but much like zgv holes in the past, it drops root privs before the
overflow occurs.  However, as Nergal describes at
http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1998_4/0148.html, svgalib needs write access
to /dev/mem, and we can therefore regain root privs by overwriting our uid.

the offending code appears in plot.c where we see:

    char home[80];
...
    char *tmp_home=getenv(HOME);
...
    strcpy(home,tmp_home);

EXPLOIT:

/*
gnuplot Linux x86 exploit from xnec
tested on gnuplot Linux version 3.5 (pre 3.6) patchlevel beta 336/SuSE 5.2
gnuplot ships suidroot by default in SuSE 5.2, maybe others

gcc -o xnec_plot xnec_plot.c
./xnec_plot <bufsiz> <offset>

The buffer we're overflowing is only 80 bytes, so we're going to have to
get our settings just so.  If you don't feel like typing in command line
offsets and bufsizes, make a little shell script:
---
#! /bin/bash
bufsiz=110
offset=0

while [ $offset -lt 500 ]; do
  ./xnec_plot $bufsiz $offset
  offset=`expr $offset + 10`
done
---
since gnuplot drops root privs after it inits your svga, we can't just exec
/bin/sh, we'll need to use the technique of replacing our saved uid
in /dev/mem with '0', then execing whatever we please.  We do this by compiling
Nergal's program, mem.c and putting the output file in /tmp/xp, as in
gcc -o /tmp/xp mem.c.  Nergal's program will then make /tmp/sh suidroot,
so don't forget to cp /bin/sh /tmp/sh.  You will also have to change
line 32 to the correct address of kstat, which can be obtained by doing
strings /proc/ksyms | grep kstat.

Since I can see absolutely no reason for gnuplot to be suidroot, the best
fix is chmod -s /usr/bin/gnuplot.

FIX:

Since I see absolutely no good reason why gnuplot should be suidroot (who,
besides root, is going to run it, anyway?), I would recommend a simple
chmod -s /usr/bin/gnuplot.  If you absolutely insist on suid, here's the patch:

        else               p = home;

However, this by no means was a comprehensive security audit of gnuplot, so
there may very well be a dozen other problems I've not fixed.

It is interesting to note that the gnuplot on my system is NOT suid root
(nor have I modified the default installed settings).  My version is 3.5
patchlevel 3.50.1.17 (i.e. very old).  The distribution is Slackware.

I agree with xnec in that I can see no good reason to make it suid root.
Anyone know why this was done?  Anytime a program is going to do this, a
full audit should be made - some people take the suid bit not seriously
enough.

Simply running strings against it should cause someone looking at that
output to feel a bit suspicious.

Granted, the suid bit might be placed by the distribution and not the
program's author.

Finally, thanks to xnec for providing BOTH the exploit and the fix which
is how it should be done on a full disclosure list.

 This particular piece of code has been changed before the release of
 gnuplot release 3.7 to use a "safe" version of strncpy(). We recommend
 that all vendors shipping obsolete beta versions of gnuplot upgrade.

 It is my understanding that gnuplot requires root privileges so that
 SVGAlib can access the gfx board. Other than that, there is no reason
 for making it suid, and I'd rather prefer a better solution.

I strongly second this recommendment. I'll mail S.u.S.E. about it, if
no-one else does (but then, they're bound to have someone reading bugtraq,
right?).

to the bugtraqers: Note that suidroot installation of gnuplot is done
*only* if SVGAlib is found at compile time, and actually used by gnuplot.
So, instead of explicitly disallowing suidroot, the *safe* solution is
to pass the '--without-linux-vga' option to 'configure' to disable
use of SVGAlib, and that's that.

This would also be my suggestion for Linux distributors: put gnuplot into
the 'x-applications' class of packages, compile using
'--without-linux-vga', and make a note in the package description that a
SVGAlib version can be built, as well (or offer that as a separate
package, like it was routinely done with ghostscript, the major precedent
case).

OTOH, no-one with any kind of security concern on their mind would install
SVGAlib, in its current state, would they?

If you use SuSE and you care a _lot_ about local security you must edit
/etc/rc.config and set PERMISSION_SECURITY="paranoid". That way gnuplot
would _not_ be suidroot. See the contents of /etc/permissions.paranoid:

root@laser:/home/andrea# grep gnuplot /etc/permissions.paranoid
# WHY ON HELL was gnuplot suid root !!!!!
/usr/bin/gnuplot                       root.root        755

Using PERMISSION_SECURITY="secure" was just installing tvscreen _not_
suidroot.

Using PERMISSION_SECURITY="easy" (and note: you are asked to set "easy"
instead of "secure") is very riskious in a envinronment that has to be
secured, but you asked for that so don't complain (e.g. about xtvscreen).

I just tried once to fix the disinformation on the list about SuSE
xtvscreen suidroot but Aleph One didn't accepted my email. I don't know
why Aleph One didn't accepted my first email. Aleph?
