Netscape Communicator is a great product. Sure, it has great security
improvements. I like and use it. But it does not fix all of the exploits
at http://www.whitehats.com/guninski/netscape.html. I have tested (NC
4.51 Win95) and had some reports that the exploit
http://www.whitehats.com/guninski/nsfind.html (or
http://www.nat.bg/~joro/nsfind.html) still works on Netscape
Communicator 4.51. I would recommend still disabling JavaScript when
browsing untrusted sites.

Excuse me, if I am wrong.

    I downloaded and installed Netscape 4.51 and I can still run the Javascript
exploit that allows access to my harddrive...

    Is it just me, or does anyone else see this as a gaping security hole for
Netscape 4.5x users......
