Subject: Hacking USER's email with WinGate, lack of security on some ISPs

   Found out something to read some emails on my ISP, maybe this will work 
   with other people if the ISP's site works just like mine...
   It consists that, i lately noticed i'd get a "Dear brunob" when entering 
   their site. I scanned for a WinGate on my ISP's IPs.. Once i have a 
   WinGate working with www proxyin on 80(always had www proxy open), i 
   would use this proxy, and redirect to the ISP's Site, and it'd recogzine 
   myself as the USER from that WinGate's IP... It's all based on the IP the 
   person connects from.. So, i had a "Dear BLAH2"... And i found out i could 
   see someone's billing account... I used the same techniq on another ISP 
   and i could see in this ISP the USER's WEB MAIL section, without having to 
   enter any password or username.. In this last ISP i could also see the 
   person's billing account.. If people here like to read other people emails, 
   this is a way, IF they have WinGate set up, with permission to anyone to 
   connect to them..
