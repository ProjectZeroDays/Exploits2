Subject: IE5 Feature/security hole

In Internet Explorer 5, there is a feature, that remembers what you type
into web page forms, so that if you ever come to enter that field again,
it will drop down a box of your previous inputs.
(Note, the first time you come to a form, it will ask you wether or not
you want to enable this function, and you can say no)

Good feature? Perhaps, it could be time saving, when say, having to type
in your name on a form everytime.

Security Hole? Yes.  Credit Card Numbers, social security numbers,
usernames, addresses.  It will drop down a box with previous entered data.
So if you say have a web site were you order stuff online, or entered some
sort of data to verify yourself, the next person to use your computer can
go to that same site, and have a nice list of what you typed.  At a home
computer the risk is limited to who you let use your computer, but at
things like schools, or other areas where many people share the same
computer, this could become a security/privacy problem.  I verified it
does work with Credit Card numbers on secure sites. I tested on CDNow and
amazon.com (pretty popular sites to enter CC info).


I think this feature is one that everyone needs to know to make sure is
OFF.
