Subject: Default password in Bay Networks switches.

        Ok.. so you would think after 3Com $%#& up last year of inserting
        default password into firmware vendors would learn their lesson?
        [See http://geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1998_2/0340.html for 3com rant]

        Hah! Welcome to the world of strings and Bay Networks firmware
        files. I have looked at some bay networks switches and see that
        the following have default password of "NetICs"

BayStack 350T   HW:RevC  FW:V1.01 SW:V1.2.0.10
BayStack 350T   HW:RevC  FW:V1.01 SW:V2.0.0.15

        These however I was not able to find defaults for:

BayStack 350-24T HW:RevA  FW:V1.04 SW:V1.0.0.2
Bay Networks BayStack 303 Ethernet Switch
BayStack 28115/ADV Fast Ethernet Switch

        If you have firmware images for the above, just

% strings *.img | grep -B5 "Invalid Password"

        Something similar to this command might give you the passwd.
        Of course I don't have to tell you about how bad it is when
        someone can control your network infrastructure (switches).

        I don't have much experience with Bay hardware (in fact, I have
        none - someone at work just asked me to help them get into a
        switch for which they forgot the password). If someone can
        shed some light on this topic, it would be great.

        And yes, I consider this to be a backdoor - wouldn't you call it
        a backdoor if Solaris had default password for root logins?
        How can vendors in 1999 even THINK about something as stupid as
        inserting a default password like this into a switch!?!?
        Granted - I am almost sure Bay didn't have evil intentions for
        the use .. but still. I am speechless.

The Bay Networks case number for this bug/oversight is: 990310-614

Normally "backdoor" passwords on Bay gear only work through the console.

This was fixed in version 2.0.3.4 of the BS350 code last November.
The backdoor is still there for console access, but not for telnet.
This problem only affected the Baystack 350T and 350F, it did not
affect the 350-24T or 450.  Also, note that the 350 has always had the
ability to limit telnet logins to certain source addresses; it is
recommended that that feature be used.

Software upgrades for the 350 can be found at
http://support.baynetworks.com under Software.  If you don't
have a support contract, call (800) 2LANWAN.

Sorry, should have included this in the first email.

Regardless of the existence of backdoors (not to say they aren't evil) it
is a good idea to limit who can connect to your equipment over the
network.  These BayStack switches have a "TELNET Configuration..." menu
where you can turn off telnet access and/or limit the IP addresses who are
allowed to telnet in.  While you're there you should secure your SNMP,
which is another item commonly left wide open (any networking equipment,
not just Bay).

Many networking devices don't have the ability to restrict who can connect
to them.  Even if the device does have the ability, it is often useful to
take care of securing all networking devices at once.  One way to do this
is to allocate a separate IP network for your network devices. This would
mean two IP networks on your physical network, your "main" IP network, and
the small "management" IP network.  At the gateway (eg a secondary IP on a
cisco's ethernet interface) into your management network you configure
ACLs to securely control connections to your devices.  Of course if the
gateway goes down you suddenly can't remotely admin any of the protected
devices, a good reason to have an out-of-band management system in place.
