Subject: [0z0n3] XCmail remotely exploitable vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I have found a vulnerability in xcmail that is exploitable,
a simple buffer overflow vulnerability.

The bug appears when replying to a message with a long subject line, and
only when autoquote is on (dunno why... i didn't have time to read the
sources, and I'm so lazy) ....

the exploit is trivial, but as the buffer is not very large you have to do
very precise return address calculation, and i believe it IS remotely
exploitable, but you have to know a lot about the machine you want to gain
acces to... so this definitely won't be useful to script kiddies
(rootshell.com folks: don't waste your time ;)

maybe one could upload a script by ftp, and modify the shellcode so that
it copies the file to /tmp, chmod()s it and executes it...

sample exploit attached.

THE AUTHORS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED, and they responded quickly.
