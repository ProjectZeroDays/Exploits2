I've come across an issue regarding Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 and 6.5.  SQL
Server has a management tool called SQL Explorer (used to manage the
server).  If your SQL Server is set to use normal userid/password
authentication and not integrated NT authentication, Explorer stores your
userid and password in clear text. (6.0 stores it in a file in the same
subdirectory of the software, 6.5 in the HKCU's registry hive).

I would expect alittle more from a company like Microsoft...

I checked this out and the password is visible in my registry as clear text
inside a binary block.  However the product name of this management tool is
SQL Enterprise Manager, not SQL Explorer.

Until this problem is address by Microsoft, an effective workaround for
dba's using Enterprise Manger would be to unregister all servers before
exit.

A number of people have written in response to Stephen's observations
about finding the plaintext password for a registered SQL server in the
registry. As Stephen stated in his original message, he had chosen Basic
Authentication rather than NT Authentication.

Using NT Authentication prevents the issue completely.

SQL 7.0 eliminates the possibility of using Basic Authentication for
this purpose, relying entirely on NT Authentication. Ergo Microsoft
feels they have addressed the problem.

So, a workaround exists (use NT Authentication only or unregister
servers), and a fix has been made to the next version of SQL server
(i.e. SQL 7.0).

However Stephen's original point, that the product does store plaintext
passwords in non-protected areas of the registry if configured to use
Basic Authentication, should not be discarded.
