Subject: additionally  NT Y2K issue (post SP4)

It should also be pointed out that the java virtual machine that installs
with IE on the sp4 CD is not y2k compliant either and needs to be upgraded.

Some versions of the Microsoft Virtual Machine, including the versions that
shipped with SP4 and with some versions of Internet Explorer, have Year
2000 date-related issues. Please refer to the Microsoft VM year 2000
Product Guide at Microsoft Virtual Machine for details and recommendations
to address known issues.

I suspect this will go on for awhile
