Subject: Re: Outlook stores PLAINTEXT password!

Although this may not be an appropriate topic for this list, there is a 
related issue with Outlook password protected add-ins.

Many companies make add-in components for Microsoft Outlook such as 
custom forms or folders.  These add-ins are password protected to 
protect code.  However, when these passwords are checked at runtime, 
they are left in memory as plaintext.  And since Outlook forms aren't 
compiled, all code is available to anyone with a password.
