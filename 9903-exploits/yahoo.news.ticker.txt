FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

Application:   Yahoo! NEWS TICKER
Platforms  :   Win95,98,NT

Advisory:

The installation process of the Yahoo! NEWS TICKER 
leaves a file name "install.log" in the program 
directory.  The file contains plaintext userid and 
password.

The installation process also sets registry entries 
under hkey_local_machine/software/netcontrols/ticker  
that contain the plaintext userID and password.


Each yahoo account uses the same password/userid for 
all parts including auctions, news, my.yahoo, 
classifieds, and most importantly, EMAIL!!!!

this is an independant finding not a release by Yahoo!.
