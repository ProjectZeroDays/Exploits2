It was previously reported on bugtraq that the command
"/usr/xpg4/bin/more /proc/self/psinfo" will crash U10, UE3000,
etc. running SunOS 5.7.

Sun is aware of this (has assigned a bugid):

Hi!

some more information about this very issue.

both (32bit,64bit) sparc versions of Solaris 7 can be crashed by
unprivileged user. /usr/xpg4/bin/more command will trigger the bug. FYI
I got message from Sun kernel developer team member only minutes after
my e-mail to bugtraq and after some consultation they were able to
reproduce bug and find the cause, so expect patch soon.

intel version of solaris 7 seems to be immune to this bug, however.

with this, I'd like to close this issue. please send questions about
this not for me, but Sun :)
