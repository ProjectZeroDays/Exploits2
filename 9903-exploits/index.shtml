Features: Replaces GUID with either zeros or an optional string you specify. Can make backup copies in case something unforseek should occur. Can log it's actions to a file you specify. Can replace the GUID on all Office files in a given directory or even drive. Detects office files based on content not name so it will even fix Document Templates. Optional logging of the original GUID. Support for running from the command line allowing, macros or batch files to call it. By <a href="http://www.vecdev.com/guideon.html">Vector Development</a>.
