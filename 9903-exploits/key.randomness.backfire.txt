Are your secrets safe? 
Duncan Graham-Rowe

THEY MAY LOOK HARMLESS but screensavers could betray you while you're out
at lunch. Two cryptographers have discovered that the randomness of the
"keys" that are used to encode encrypted documents could be their
downfall.

The discovery was made by Adi Shamir at the Weizmann Institute of Science
in Rehovot, Israel, joint inventor of the widely used RSA public key
cryptography system, and Nicko van Someren of nCipher, a British
electronic security company based in Cambridge. The more random a private
signature key is, the harder it is to crack encrypted files. But by
scanning hard drives for chunks of data that are particularly random, the
pair found that it is possible to weed out keys stored on a disc.

Most programs organise data into some sort of level of structure, so
blocks of randomness stand out and can be spotted with the same ease that
a human eye can tell the difference between a good TV picture from one
with lots of interference. According to van Someren, this means that even
though the keys take up a mere kilobyte of memory, it could take as little
as 40 minutes to find a signature key on a modern 10-gigabyte hard drive.

"It would be possible to write a program that searches the hard disc
automatically and sends the key to the villain," says van Someren. This,
he says, could be carried out by a virus that runs only when the
screensaver is on, making it extremely difficult for the user to detect. A
running screensaver could contain viral code that would tell a hacker when
the user is away from their desk--and thus wouldn't notice the computer
slowing down as the virus hunts for keys.

The possibility highlights the need to keep signature keys safe, says Phil
Zimmermann, who wrote Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), a popular encryption
program that is reckoned to be hard to crack. "Users must never leave
their private key exposed in a non-secure environment," he says. "This is
as obvious as not leaving your wallet unattended on a bus bench."

Any worthwhile encryption program encrypts the key before storing it,
making it useless if found. However, a "swap" file--a temporary file
stored on the hard disc--may still hold the key in its unencrypted form,
allowing it to be detected by hackers. There are ways to combat this sort
of attack, such as overwriting swap files as the PGP program does. But
some encryption systems are vulnerable, particularly those on Web servers
where the keys are constantly in use.
