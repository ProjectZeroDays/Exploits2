- -----------------------
- --- Issue Specifics ---
- -----------------------

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the X server's
font path which can lead to a root compromise.

Silicon Graphics Inc. has investigated the issue and recommends the
following steps for neutralizing the exposure.  It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
that these measures be implemented on ALL vulnerable SGI systems.
This issue has been corrected in future releases of IRIX.


- --------------
- --- Impact ---
- --------------

An X server is installed by default on all IRIX platforms.

A local user account on the vulnerable system is required in order to
exploit X server font path.

The buffer overflow vulnerability can lead to a root compromise.

This X server's font path vulnerability has been publicly discussed in
Usenet newsgroups and mailing lists.



- --------------------------
- --- Temporary Solution ---
- --------------------------

Unfortunately, there are no immediate or temporary workarounds for
this issue.  This issue can only be addressed with the installation
of a patch.

   NOTES

     1) Upgrade to currently supported IRIX operating system.
        See http://support.sgi.com/news/irix2.html for more information.
     2) This version of the IRIX operating system is in maintenance mode
        and patches will no longer be produced when it retires.
        See http://support.sgi.com/news/irix1.html for more information.
     3) If you have not received an IRIX 6.5.Xm Maintenance Release Stream
        CD, contact your SGI Support Provider or download the IRIX 6.5.X
        Maintenance Release Stream from http://support.sgi.com/ or
        ftp://support.sgi.com/support/relstream/

Patches are available via anonymous FTP and your service/support provider.

The primary SGI anonymous FTP site for security information and patches
is sgigate.sgi.com (204.94.209.1). Security information and patches can be
found in the ~ftp/security and ~ftp/patches directories, respectively.

For security and patch management reasons, ftp.sgi.com (mirror of sgigate)
lags behind and does not do a real-time update of ~ftp/security and
~ftp/patches
