Hello! I'm trying my TV.I saw a Grundig remote control application on
Google Play.
Computer I downloaded and decompiled APK. And I began to examine individual
classes.
I noticed in a class that a request was sent during operations on the
command line.
I downloaded the phone packet viewer and opened the control application and
made some operations.
And I saw that there was such a request;

GET /sendrcpackage?keyid=-2547&keysymbol=-4078 HTTP/1.1

I noticed that each process has an id value. Then I turned off the
television using the control application and noted the outgoing IDs.
The only requirement for the connection between the TV and the application
was to have the same IP address.
After I made the IP address on the TV and the phone and the IP address on
the computer the same: I accessed the interface from the 8085 port.
Now I could do anything from the computer :)
